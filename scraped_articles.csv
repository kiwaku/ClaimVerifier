Video footage and still images have appeared on Russian social media that appear to show the violent interrogation of several of the men alleged to have taken part in the deadly terror attack on a concert hall outside Moscow Friday.

One video appears to show one of the suspects, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, being held on the ground while having part of his ear cut off by a camouflage-wearing interrogator. Rachabalizoda later appeared in court with a heavily bandaged ear.

The Grey Zone, a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel, published a still photograph that claims to show the electrocution of one of the detained suspects.

Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Russian state propaganda network RT, posted a video that appears to show the interrogation of another suspect, Shamsidin Fariduni, who is shown stammering and shaking as he is questioned by interrogators off camera. Fariduni subsequently appeared in court with a bruised face.

CNN asked the Kremlin about the “visible signs of violence” committed against the suspects, but spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment.",https://edition.cnn.com
3,Why this is a wild week for Trump even by his standards,"CNN —

Donald Trump’s tumultuous life has been rocked by bankruptcies, personal scandals, impeachments and election wins and losses, but nothing quite compares to the personal and financial crisis facing the once-and-possibly future president this week.

Trump is struggling to post a bond worth around half a billion dollars on Monday to stop the state of New York from targeting his assets following a huge fraud judgment. The situation he finds himself in threatens the empire that conjured the tycoon’s aura and assumptions of massive wealth that are critical to his self-identity and political brand.

But exemplifying the roller-coaster nature of his public career, Trump is also soon poised for a massive financial windfall. A deal to take his media company public promises to add about $3 billion to his net wealth – even if it won’t ease his cash crunch in the short term.

That’s not all. Trump may find out Monday when he will become the first ex-president to go on trial, as the judge hearing a Manhattan hush money case holds a critical hearing. The case, related to payment to an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election, could lead to Trump being a convicted felon by November’s election.

All of this is unfolding as he battles on multiple fronts to delay and discredit three other criminal trials, all in which he’s pleaded not guilty. He nonetheless has cemented his dominance over the Republican Party and leads President Joe Biden in some swing-state polls as he attempts the most stunning comeback in political history after he left office in disgrace after trying to steal the 2020 election.

It’s an extraordinary collision between Trump’s personal, legal and political controversies, all of which reflect the contradictions of a unique figure who has repeatedly flirted with financial ruin and tested the law but who has an uncanny capacity to dodge, or at least delay, accountability.

Since Trump swept aside all opposition in his triumphant sprint to his third-straight Republican nomination and has a strong chance of being the 47th president, his fortunes and fate are yet again inextricably entangled with the nation’s in a turbulent political era.

Trump’s empire is on shaky ground

The ex-president’s most immediate threat lies in the need to post bond worth $464 million, including interest, after he, his adult sons and the Trump Organization were found to have committed massive fraud by a judge after a civil trial. The payment is needed to allow Trump time to appeal and to head off a threat by New York Attorney General Letitia James to start going after his assets and property empire if he cannot pay up.

The saga has been a humiliating one for the ex-president since it raises questions about his claims to a huge fortune. Trump’s lawyers have asked the appeals court judges to reduce or delay the judgment for ill-gotten gains, but they are yet to rule. His legal team said last week the bond amount was a “practical impossibility” for Trump, whose wealth is tied up in skyscrapers and golf resorts. And more than 30 insurance firms declined to underwrite the bond.

Trump’s legal team has also said he shouldn’t be required to sell assets to meet the deadline since doing so would create a fire sale devastating to his business. Trump has already been forced to come up with a bond guaranteed by an insurance firm for more than $90 million as he appeals a defamation verdict delivered by a jury hearing a case against him by the writer E. Jean Carroll.

It’s possible that Trump could find a private donor or donors to help him post the payment at the eleventh hour. And it’s not inevitable that his failure to do so would prompt James to move immediately. She could begin her asset search, for instance, by subpoenaing Trump for full details of his financial situation. But the New York attorney general has already lodged court paperwork that suggests Trump’s Seven Springs estate and golf course in Westchester County, New York, outside Manhattan, could be among her first targets.

As with his other outstanding legal cases, the ex-president has substituted a political defense for a legal one, claiming that he is the victim of persecution designed to keep him out of power. (There’s no evidence the cases, which proceeded through proper legal channels, are connected or that there is interference by the Biden White House.) Over the weekend, Trump prepared the groundwork for a new political assault, sending out a stream of frenzied fundraising appeals – including one titled “Maniacs want to seize Trump Tower” – and claimed he was standing in the way of the government coming after his millions of grassroots supporters.

How an asset sweep might unfold

The consequences of an asset seizure could be devastating for Trump and distract from his general election campaign.

“If he can’t deliver the security, and the court doesn’t give him dispensation from having to deliver the security, then starting on Tuesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James can start trying to execute against his property, which would be broken down into three categories,” white-collar litigator Mitchell Epner said on CNN on Saturday. One category could cover cash and bank and securities accounts. A second would encompass personal property ranging from clothing to vehicles and planes. The third contains real estate.

“On that spectrum, the cash can get grabbed the most quickly; personal property will take a little bit longer. And the real estate takes the longest period of time, but that process will start on Tuesday. And once that starts, he really can’t do anything in order to stop it from happening,” Epner told Fredricka Whitfield.

The spectacle of a presumptive nominee enduring such an ordeal would be explosive and could have unpredictable political consequences. This may explain why there is no sign yet that James is targeting Trump Tower – one of the citadels of his empire – despite the ex-president’s claims over the weekend. While Trump has successfully used his four criminal indictments to solidify his support base among Republican primary voters, the country is entering unprecedented territory with a presumptive nominee facing severe financial duress as a result of a fraud judgement. The staggering array of legal threats bearing down on Trump would be oppressive for any defendant, let alone a potential president, and raises the possibility that he could further alienate the moderate Republican, independent and suburban voters who helped Biden oust him after a single term in 2020.

Trump and his supporters have argued that the verdict against him in the case is massively inflated and have accused James, a Democrat, of bias. But Judge Arthur Engoron found that the ex-president, his adult sons and the firm had for years inflated the value of their assets to get better treatment from insurance firms and banks in a way that threatened the integrity of the financial system.

On Sunday, Trump used Truth Social to lash out at the prosecutor and judge, once again conflating his legal defense with his campaign. “THESE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT MADE AMERICA GREAT, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DESTROYING AMERICA!” Trump wrote.

The White House has done its best not to comment on the case, to avoid giving Trump more political ammunition. But some leading Democrats argue he’s now finding out that the law does not favor the rich and famous. “It is my belief that all people should be treated equally under the law,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. The New York Democrat added: “And if that seizure of assets would be pursued to any other American, then Donald Trump should be treated the same.”

Trump awaits a massive financial boost – on paper, at least

Despite his money woes in New York, Trump could get a massive boost as early as Tuesday when a merger closes between Trump Media and Technology Group and Digital World Acquisition Corp., a shell company.

The former president will not be able to turn around and use his new wealth on paper to finance his bond, however, since he’s restricted from selling his shares for six months – and if he does so eventually, the value of the securities could plummet. There are also long-term concerns about the prospects of the firm, which is minuscule compared with social media giants such as X or Facebook.

Still, the merger agreement calls for Trump to own roughly 79 million shares of the new public company – and potentially tens of millions more if certain goals are hit. At times last week, Digital World was trading at around $43, although it eventually fell back. But Trump’s stake could be in the region of $3 billion, at least initially.

Only Trump could face a potentially existential threat to his financial security and his firm while at the same time getting a potential $3 billion windfall.

Monday could have been far worse for Trump, as it was the original date set for the debut of the hush money trial. But Judge Juan Merchan delayed proceedings until at least the middle of next month after more than 100,000 documents were turned over by the US attorney for the Southern District of New York related to the prosecution of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, who is a key witness in the case.

The former president’s attorneys are now calling for a delay of 90 days or even a dismissal of the 34 counts of falsifying business records. Merchan could indicate on Monday whether the delay he has already put in place is sufficient to allow the trial to move ahead.

Trump has portrayed the case in the same way as all the others – as an attempt to keep him out of the White House. The former president has also pleaded not guilty in three other criminal cases – two over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and one concerning the classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort after he left the White House.

Some legal analysts, meanwhile, argue the Manhattan trial is the least threatening criminal case to Trump since it is unlikely to lead to jail time, even if he is found guilty. And since the alleged criminality in question dates to before the 2016 election, there’s also an argument that its impact on a general election eight years later could be limited.

But America has never seen an ex-president go on trial for anything – let alone months from the date when he will ask voters for a second term.

The only certainty about Trump is that he never stops shattering precedent.",https://edition.cnn.com
4,Water trickling and taps running dry are part of daily life in South Africa’s biggest city,"Johannesburg CNN —

When Duane Riley turns on his taps, they shudder loudly from the air flowing through the pipes. There’s often no water trickling at all.

It’s ironic, because Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city, has plenty of water at the moment — authorities and water companies just can’t seem to get it to where it’s needed.

“There have been times where we’ve had no water, but I’ve had a river gushing down my driveway, because there was a leak at the top of our street,” Riley told CNN. It took authorities 14 days to fix it, he said.

Joburgers — as residents here call themselves — are no strangers to water scarcity. South Africa is naturally dry, and the climate crisis has hit the nation many times with crippling drought.

Johannesburg is one of many of the world’s big cities that are dealing with a perfect storm of crumbling critical infrastructure, lack of maintenance, corruption and insufficient planning for population growth.

While drought can hurt the city’s reservoirs, the dams are currently full, authorities say. But climate change is making things worse in another way — officials say a weeks-long heat wave is boosting water demand in enormous volumes. In February, Southern Africa saw temperatures of 4 to 5 degrees Celsius (around 7 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) above average.

At around 9 p.m., Riley’s home typically loses water until around six in the morning.

“But there have been multiple times where we’ve been without water for five, seven days,” he said.

It’s impacting many parts of the city, from the wealthy northern suburbs to parts of the largest township, Soweto. In both places, people have been forced to collect water in buckets from wherever they can.

Two months out from an election, authorities are blaming the latest shortages on a lightning strike on a pumping station, and also pointing to the heat wave.

But locals are no longer buying the excuses.

“The heat wave we’ve been battling for two weeks. But we’ve been dealing with this long, long before that,” says Riley, who lives in Kensington, a hilly suburb east of the city. He says the battle has been going on for about a year.

“They are just grabbing at straws trying to save face, and whatever excuse they can find to not really reflect the biggest issue,” added Riley. That issue, he said, is maintenance.

Riley recently organized two protests against the lack of basic services, including water and electricity supply, in his area, which hundreds of people attended.

Ravin Singh founded the Water Crisis Committee civic group last September, after his neighborhood northeast of downtown Johannesburg was suddenly hit with prolonged outages.

He’s had periods of more than a week without water. “The current situation is that we have water for parts of the day,” he said.

For some who do get water, it often comes at a trickle, with low to no pressure at all, Singh says.

“Young families are able to cope, although it impacts on their work [and] life. They have to change the patterns of when they bathe, when they cook, those kinds of things,” he said. “But people in old-age homes, for example, it’s very difficult.”

Singh says in the seven or eight months since the problems began in his area, he’s only seen a water tanker to provide emergency supplies around three times. And it’s difficult for the elderly to walk and carry water home.

On Wednesday, Senzo Mchunu, the government minister for Water and Sanitation, urged the City of Johannesburg to work on its turnaround time in responding to pipe bursts and leaks “as this is what is contributing to the high physical water losses.” In a statement, Mchunu said “it was clear” the city “requires serious interventions and funding to deal with its water infrastructure renewal program.”

Johannesburg Water said in a statement Wednesday that its systems were “steadily improving and stabilising” after the trouble over the past two or so weeks. The company called on residents and businesses to help cut water use by 10%, requesting people fix leaks on their properties, take shorter showers and collect rainwater for outdoor use.

This is a message it has been urged to pass on by the area’s supplier, Rand Water. In a statement on March 18, Rand Water said the metro areas of Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg must reduce their water consumption to avert interrupted supply.

Johannesburg’s reservoirs have long struggled with fluctuating levels, affected by natural events and high consumption. In September last year, authorities warned the city’s reservoirs and water towers were “critically low to empty” following a thunderstorm that caused a power failure at a treatment plant.

Because many reservoirs are powered by electric pumps, high levels of scheduled power outages, or “load shedding” as it’s known in South Africa, have also cause low water levels at reservoirs. Now Joburgers also talk about “water shedding.”

But Singh concedes that people could be doing more to lower water consumption, voluntarily.

“I think it’s important, even if we didn’t have this crisis, we need to remind citizens that we live in a water-scarce country,” he said. “And we need to cut consumption.”

If behaviors do not change, and maintenance and modernization of the water system are not taken seriously, Johannesburg could find itself in an even bleaker situation.

It doesn’t need to look far to see what that future could be: Only two years ago, the South African city of Cape Town was counting down to “Day Zero,” the day all taps would run dry. It averted that crisis. Now Joburgers are wondering if their city can do the same.",https://edition.cnn.com
5,"Laurent de Brunhoff, ‘Babar the Elephant’ author, dies aged 98","CNN —

Writer and illustrator Laurent de Brunhoff, who continued his father’s legacy by producing dozens of original books for his “Babar the Elephant” series, has died aged 98.

De Brunhoff died at his home in Key West, Florida on Friday following a recent stroke, his wife, the critic and author Phyllis Rose, told CNN via email.

A citizen of both France and the US, de Brunhoff published more than 40 books featuring Babar, an impeccably well-dressed elephant dreamed up by his mother, Cécile, and brought to life by his illustrator father, Jean, in the 1930s.

“The start — (the) very start of Babar — was a bed(time) story from my mother,” de Brunhoff told CNN in an interview, aired in 2003. “And my brother and I loved the story. We went to my father’s studio and told him about it. He started to make a book for us. After the first book he made another one and another one. And he just discovered himself, I think.”

De Brunhoff was just 12 when his father died of tuberculosis, in 1937, having published five books for the series. These early titles see the green-suited Babar leave the jungle for Paris when his mother is shot by a hunter, before embarking on various adventures and being crowned king of the elephants.

A further two of his father’s books were published posthumously — and a then-teenage de Brunhoff colored and designed a cover illustration for the seventh and last of his Babar titles.

Sharing his father’s gift for illustration, de Brunhoff studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière art school in the French capital and worked as an abstract painter. In 1946, at the age of 21, he revived Babar with the first of his own books, “Babar’s Cousin: That Rascal Arthur.”

“I wanted Babar to live again,” he told CNN in 2003.

Global phenomenon

In the decades after his father’s death, de Brunhoff introduced new characters and storylines, helping popularize the series and bring it to a global audience. His original tales saw Babar traveling around the world with his family, learning how to cook, taking up yoga and even visiting an alien planet. His most recent book for the series, “Babar’s Guide to Paris,” was published in 2017, more than 70 years after he first revived the character.

Despite capturing the imagination of generations of children, the series has been accused of being an allegory of — and justification for — French colonialism. Some of Jean de Brunhoff’s original illustrations and storylines have meanwhile been criticized for employing racist stereotypes.

In the 1980s, Chilean author Ariel Dorfman argued that Babar’s story — including his adoption of human clothes and mannerisms, and the subsequent depictions of him bringing the benefits of human civilization back to the jungle — represented the “fulfillment of the dominant countries’ colonial dream.”

“Babar slips progress into the jungle without upsetting the ecological balance, because (Jean) de Brunhoff omits all the plundering, racism, underdevelopment and misery from his story of the relationship between the two worlds,” Dorfman wrote in his 1983 book, “The Empire’s Old Clothes: What the Lone Ranger, Babar, and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds.”

When asked about Dorfman’s critique by National Geographic in 2014, de Brunhoff appeared to accept the idea that the series perpetuated myths about French colonialism.

“I think it’s right. Absolutely,” he told the magazine. “In some way, it’s a little embarrassing to see Babar fighting with Black people in Africa. My second book, ‘Babar’s Picnic,’ was also inspired by my father’s drawing. Some years later, I felt embarrassed about this book, and I asked the publisher to withdraw it.”

The series has been translated into numerous languages, and Babar was also adapted for TV on several occasions, beginning with a production for NBC in the late 1960s. A later series, “Babar,” premiered in 1989 on CBC in Canada and HBO in the US (HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery), while the more recent “Babar and the Adventures of Badou” aired on various channels globally, including Disney Junior, between 2010 and 2015.

Tributes to de Brunhoff flooded in over the weekend following news of his death. Writing to X, formerly Twitter, the Oscar-nominated writer, director and actor Whit Stillman described his Babar books as “exquisitely beautiful and charming.”

New York’s Mary Ryan Gallery, which represented de Brunhoff’s illustrations, said on Instagram that the writer and illustrator’s “love for Babar, his art and family story have touched millions across the globe.”",https://edition.cnn.com
6,Shohei Ohtani set to speak Monday as theft allegations against his interpreter spur investigation,"CNN —

Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani is expected to address the media Monday as Major League Baseball investigates allegations of theft against his longtime interpreter.

“I’m happy he’s going to speak – speak to what he knows and give his thoughts on the whole situation,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters Sunday. “I think it’ll give us a little bit more clarity.”

Will Ireton, a Dodgers employee, will serve as Ohtani’s interpreter, Roberts said.

The allegations came to light last week when Ohtani’s Japanese interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired after Ohtani’s lawyers accused him of “massive theft” of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookmaker under federal investigation, according to ESPN and the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story.

Ohtani signed an unparalleled 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers this offseason.

Ohtani, who doesn’t speak often with reporters, has not spoken publicly since Mizuhara’s firing.

The scandal has threatened to overshadow the start of MLB’s Opening Day on Thursday, challenged the public’s understanding of one of baseball’s biggest stars, and brought renewed scrutiny to professional sports’ closeness with gambling.

The MLB and the Internal Revenue Service are separately investigating Mizuhara.

“Major League Baseball has been gathering information since we learned about the allegations involving Shohei Ohtani and Ippei Mizuhara from the news media,” the league said in a news release last week. “Earlier today, our Department of Investigations began their formal process investigating the matter.”

The IRS Criminal Investigation Los Angeles Field Office is investigating both Mizuhara and Mathew Bowyer, IRS spokesman Scott Villiard told CNN on Friday.

Bowyer, a former bookmaker, is a California resident who bankruptcy court documents show had gambling debts of $425,000 more than a decade ago.

Ohtani and Mizuhara first worked together from 2013 to 2017 when Mizuhara served as a translator for the Nippon-Ham Fighters, Ohtani’s team with Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball League, according to MLB.com. When Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, he asked Mizuhara to join him as his translator in his rookie season, and Mizuhara eventually followed the star to the Dodgers, CNN previously reported.

ESPN’s Tisha Thompson, citing multiple unnamed sources, said on CNN’s “The Lead” Wednesday at least $4.5 million was withdrawn via wire transfer from Ohtani’s bank accounts, though it is unclear who initiated the transfers.

CNN has sought comment from Mizuhara and Ohtani’s agent. Ohtani’s attorneys have not detailed how they believe the funds were stolen, fueling questions about the scandal that emerged as Ohtani made his much-anticipated debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

An attorney for Bowyer, the former bookmaker under federal investigation related to gambling, said he never met or had “any direct contact” with Ohtani but did do business with Mizuhara.

“Mathew Bowyer never spoke with or emailed with or texted with or had any contact whatsoever with Shohei Ohtani,” the attorney, Diane Bass told CNN in an on-camera interview on Saturday.

The attorney also said Ohtani’s interpreter never bet on baseball.

When discussing Ohtani’s name on “one of the wire transfers to Bowyer’s organization to cover a bet,” Bass said Saturday, “as far as Mr. Bowyer understood, the bet was from Ippei, or it was being covered by Mr. Ohtani for Ippei.”

Bass emphasized while Bowyer is under federal investigation, he has not been charged with a crime. She said Bowyer stopped his bookmaking operation in October 2023 when “feds showed up at his house.”

Bowyer met Mizuhara after a Padres game in San Diego in 2022, according to Bass. She told CNN she does not know how often Mizuhara placed bets or how much he bet, but said Bowyer told her Mizuhara placed bets regularly on “primarily soccer, occasionally football and basketball, but it was never baseball.”

Mizuhara told ESPN last Tuesday, “I never bet on baseball … That’s 100 percent. I knew that rule. … We have a meeting about that in spring training.”

Bass said Mizuhara’s gambling “got out of hand at a certain point,” but “he was making regular payments for a significant amount of time.”

Asked if the payments were coming from Mizuhara’s or Ohtani’s account, Bass replied, “I honestly don’t know how many transfers came from which account(s), (or) whether it was more than one account. I don’t have access to that information,” she told CNN.

Shifting explanations and statements

The saga began with reporters asking questions about alleged wire transfers from Ohtani’s bank account. Here’s how the scandal unfolded:

• Mizuhara told ESPN in a Tuesday interview, arranged by Ohtani’s representative, he asked Ohtani last year to pay off his gambling debt, ESPN reported. Ohtani had no involvement in his betting, Mizuhara said.

• But after the interview, Ohtani’s spokesperson “disavowed” Mizuhara’s account, then released a statement saying Ohtani had been the victim of theft.

• On the same day, Mizuhara was seen smiling in the LA dugout and talking to Ohtani before translating for the star in the team’s 5-2 win over the San Diego Padres in the MLB season-opening game in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday.

• Later Wednesday, Mizuhara was fired as Ohtani’s interpreter.

• After learning about the allegations against Ohtani and Mizuhara, MLB on Friday announced it would be pursuing an investigation. The IRS also confirmed it was investigating the translator.

7,Paris waiters compete in race to get a coffee and croissant across the capital,"Paris CNN —

The army of waiters who are the lifeblood of the French capital’s many cafés often get a bad rap, accused of everything from being unable to crack a smile to being downright rude and impatient to their customers.

But the “garçons de café” of Paris are undoubtedly professionals. They can remember the orders of eight people without taking notes. They can carry all the dishes and drinks in one go. And they can manage a busy lunch rush without breaking a sweat – and still find time for a quick cigarette break.

Those professional skills (minus the smoking) were on display in full force on Sunday when Paris staged the Course des Cafés, marking the revival of a once-annual event that challenges waiters to race a two-kilometer route (1.2 miles) while carrying a tray laden with a cup of coffee, a glass of water and a croissant.

Two hundred of the crème de la crème of the city’s cafes, classically attired in black pants or skirt, apron and a white top, took to the streets and alleys of central Paris to compete in the event and entertain the crowds.

To win the race, participants not only needed to be quick but also careful. Any change to the composition of their tray would impact their final score. Absolutely no spillage was permitted. And, as the Paris city government jokingly pointed out, no eating either!

The strict requirements meant the event was less of a run and more of a speed walk.

“I tried holding the tray, it’s pretty heavy!” Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo told journalists shortly before the race started.

“You need to walk fast, but not too fast,” one female contestant told local radio station France Bleu.

Once underway, there were inevitable calamities. Water spilled, cups fell. One contestant shouted, “I can’t feel my fingers!”

There were gasps, cheers and laughter from the thousands of Parisians who decided to fight the early spring chill to watch the return of this quintessential French event, which was canceled 12 years ago due to budget constraints.

‘Excellence of French service’

It’s been revived to promote sport and “the excellence of French service” as the country gets ready to host the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Paris city government said in a statement earlier this year.

Several city officials also participated in the race, including the mayor of central Paris, Ariel Weil and the two deputy mayors of Paris in charge of Olympic affairs and business, Pierre Rabadan and Nicolas Bonnet Oulaldj.

The “Course des Garçons de Café” (cafe waiters race) was first launched in 1914 to highlight the cafés and restaurants of the French capital, according to French historian Laurent Bihl.

Throughout the years, it found popularity not only in Paris but across France in cities such as Nice, Belfort and Calais.

Across the English Channel, many towns in the UK have also adopted this race but added a little bit of local flavor – the coffee and croissant have been switched out for a pint of beer. Variations have also been staged in cities as far away as Hong Kong and Yokohama.

Back on the streets of Paris, the quickest entrants completed Sunday’s Course des Cafés race – the name of the revived version has been shortened, dropping the ‘garçons’ – in less than 14 minutes.

In the end, Pauline Van Wymeersch from the Café le Petit Pont and Samy Lamrous from La Contrescarpe were crowned the fastest woman and man.

They both won tickets to the Olympic opening ceremony this summer – and perhaps some newfound respect from those customers cursing about the time it takes to order up a coffee, croissant and a glass of water.",https://edition.cnn.com
8,Israel cancels Washington visit after US allows UN Gaza ceasefire resolution to pass,"CNN —

Tensions between the US and Israel were exposed on Monday when Washington stood aside and allowed the UN Security Council to pass a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

The US decision to abstain on the vote prompted Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel a scheduled trip to the US by two of his top advisers, two Israeli officials said.

The US had previously vetoed similar resolutions calling for a ceasefire. Its position evolved last week when on Friday, it put forward a ceasefire resolution tied tied to the release of hostages. That resolution fell when it was vetoed by Russia and China. The US abstention on Monday’s vote allowed the latest resolution to pass, when the other 14 members of the 15-strong council voted yes.

The US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that while the latest resolution included edits requested by the US, Washington could not vote yes because it “did not agree with everything.”

“A ceasefire could have come about months ago if Hamas had been willing to release hostages,” the ambassador said, calling on members states and the UNSC to demand that Hamas “accepts the deal on the table.”

“Any ceasefire must come with the release of all hostages,” she added.

The resolution, put forward by the 10 non-permanent members of the Security Council, demands an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages and “the urgent need to expand the flow” of aid into Gaza.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said a failure to implement the resolution would be “unforgivable.”

“The Security Council just approved a long-awaited resolution on Gaza, demanding an immediate ceasefire, and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

This resolution must be implemented. Failure would be unforgivable,” Guterres wrote on X, previously known as Twitter.

The UN vote on Monday came as tensions grow over a looming Israeli military operation in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah. The US has been calling on Israel to explain how it will protect the 1.4 million Palestinians seeking refuge there ahead of the expected incursion, which the US said “would be a mistake.”

Israel’s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and Ron Dermer, a member of the war cabinet and close adviser to Netanyahu, had been scheduled to travel to Washington on Monday night to discuss the offensive and US alternatives, but the visit was canceled after the vote.

National Security spokesman John Kirby offered a fuller response to Netanyahu’s decision to cancel the delegation, saying the US was disappointed by the decision to cancel the trip.

“We’re very disappointed that they will not be coming to Washington, DC, to allow us to have a fulsome conversation with them about viable alternatives to going in on the ground in Rafah,” he said.

Separately, Israel agreed to a US proposal on a prisoner-hostage deal, according to CNN analyst Barak Ravid’s reporting on the recent round of talks in Doha. The reported deal could see the release of around 700 Palestinian prisoners, among them 100 serving life sentences for killing Israeli nationals, in exchange for the release of 40 Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

However, Hamas said more issues remain unresolved beyond the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Hamas senior officials Basem Naeim told CNN that “Israeli-American media” was adding pressure on the talks.

“For us, the negotiations are not only centric around the prisoner exchange deal,” he said.

Israel has agreed to a US proposal on a prisoner-hostage exchange that would release around 700 Palestinian prisoners, among them 100 serving life sentences for killing Israelis, in exchange for the release of 40 Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to CNN analyst Barak Ravid’s reporting on the recent round of talks in Doha, Qatar.

CNN affiliate Channel 11 (Kan News) on Sunday also reported on Israel’s agreement to the US prisoner-hostage exchange proposal. Kan News cited a senior Israeli official, saying that Israel is ready to make “significant compromises in order to return the abductees home.”

Earlier in the weekend, Ravid, citing an unnamed Israeli official, tweeted that Israel agreed to a US “bridging proposal” on the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released for every hostage held by Hamas.

A diplomatic source briefed on the matter confirmed to CNN the accuracy of Ravid’s information Saturday but said outstanding issues remain, including the entry of aid and “Israeli military repositioning” in Gaza.

CNN has reached out to Israeli officials on the status of the talks.

Israel agreed to the proposal put forth by CIA Director Bill Burns, according to Ravid. Burns was in Doha, where Hamas and Israel are engaged in talks through mediators.

Hamas’ response could take one to three days, according to Ravid, who said he has spoken to Israeli officials.

“Those details need to go from Hamas representatives in Doha, who are negotiating, to the person who really calls the shots, and this is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, who is in a bunker some 100 feet under the ground, so this takes a long time,” Ravid told Omar Jimenez on “CNN Newsroom” on Sunday.

Ravid said the proposed exchange will “definitely include some” American hostages, because it will include the release of men over age 50.

‘Pressure’ on talks

Hamas pushed back against the reports, with senior officials Basem Naeim and Hussam Badran separately playing down the potential for a breakthrough.

Naeim told CNN that “Israeli-American media” was increasing the pressure on the talks.

“For us, the negotiations are not only centered around the prisoner exchange deal,” he said. “Israel has not agreed to any of (Hamas’) requests related to a complete ceasefire, the withdrawal of all forces from the Gaza Strip, even in stages, and the return of all displaced people to their homes.”

Badran said on Hamas’ Telegram page that Israel is refusing to give “any guarantees to mediators on basic issues” related to the “lives of people in Gaza.”

“We… are negotiating to reach a clear and specific goal related to the needs and requirements of our people in general and Gaza in particular,” he said.

Hamas’ latest proposal this month demanded that some 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners be released. Israel at the time described the demands as “ridiculous” and “absurd.”

An agreement, if it happens, is expected to have multiple phases. In the first stage, Hamas has proposed releasing the hostages who are women – including Israeli soldiers – elderly, sick and wounded. That number is believed to be roughly 40 out of the around 100 hostages who remain alive.

10,"Gaza Strip: Israeli forces surround two more hospitals, Palestinian Red Crescent says","CNN —

Israeli forces have surrounded two more hospitals in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said, describing intense shelling and heavy gunfire.

Months into the conflict, fighting is still raging across Gaza, despite international pressure on Israel and ongoing efforts for a ceasefire and hostage deal.

The PRCS said Sunday that Al-Amal Hospital and Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza were both encircled.

“All our teams are in extreme danger at the moment and are unable to move at all. They are also unable to bury the body of our colleague Amir Abu Aisha inside the hospital courtyard.”

CNN has reached out to hospital authorities for more detail and to the Israel Defense Forces for a response. Both hospitals were surrounded by Israeli forces for prolonged spells earlier this year.

The Israeli military is still operating at Al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest, after raiding it earlier in the week.

IDF troops “apprehended approximately 480 terrorists affiliated with the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations, and have located weapons and terrorist infrastructure in the hospital,” the IDF said in an update Sunday.

The IDF also announced that one a soldier had been killed in a battle in northern Gaza, bringing the death toll among soldiers since the ground operation began is 252.

At least 32,226 people in Gaza have died since the October 7 attacks, with almost 75,000 injured, the Gaza Ministry of health said.

In January, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that the most intensive phase of operations in northern Gaza was complete, but in recent weeks the IDF has returned in force to the area around Al-Shifa as Hamas appears to have built up its presence and operations in the area.

On Monday, the IDF launched a fresh operation at Al Shifa after claiming that “senior Hamas terrorists” were using the facility. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said about 3,000 people were seeking refuge and that those attempting to leave were being targeted by snipers and fire from helicopters.

Hamas accused Israel of striking targets “without regard” to the patients or medical staff inside – a claim echoed by people at the complex.

Hospitals have been battlegrounds throughout the conflict. Israel has accused Gazan medical facilities of harbouring Hamas fighters and weapons, something denied by doctors and the militant group.

UN Secretary General António Guterres, meanwhile warned that “horror and starvation” was stalking Gaza, calling for a ceasefire and the immediate release of hostages.

Guterres, who visited the Egyptian border on Saturday, has also called the relief trucks mounting there “a moral outrage,” urging Israel to allow “total, unfettered access for humanitarian goods throughout Gaza.”

His remarks sparked anger from Israel, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying that the UN had become “an antisemitic and anti-Israeli body that shelters and emboldens terror” under Guterres’ leadership.

Katz, in a statement on X, accused Guterres of criticizing Israel without condemning “in any way” the Hamas “terrorists who plunder humanitarian aid, without condemning UNRWA that cooperates with terrorists – and without calling for the immediate, unconditional release of all Israeli hostages.”

12,Suspects in Moscow concert hall attack appear in court as Russia defends security services,"CNN —

The four men suspected of carrying out a brutal attack at a Moscow concert hall that killed at least 137 people have appeared in court on terror charges, as the Kremlin defended its security services criticized for failing to prevent the massacre.

Three of the suspects were bent double as they were marched into the Moscow courtroom late on Sunday night, while the fourth was in a wheelchair and appeared unresponsive.

The suspects, who are from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan but worked in Russia on temporary or expired visas, were named by Moscow City Court as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Mukhammadsobir Faizov. They face a maximum sentence of life in prison.

They are accused of storming Crocus City Hall in a Moscow suburb on Friday, shooting civilians at point blank before setting the building on fire, causing the roof to collapse while concert-goers were still inside.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the massacre and released graphic footage showing the incident – but the Kremlin has alleged, without evidence, that the perpetrators planned to flee to Ukraine. Kyiv has vehemently denied involvement and called the Kremlin’s claims “absurd.”

The first suspect charged, Mirzoyev, had a black eye, bruises over his face and a plastic bag wrapped around his neck. Mirzoyev, 32, had a temporary resident permit for three months in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, but it had expired, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported.

Rachabalizoda, born in 1994, told the court through an interpreter that he has Russian registration documents but could not remember where they are.

The third defendant, Fariduni, born in 1998, was employed at a factory in the industrial city of Podolsk and registered in Krasnogorsk, both near Moscow.

The three men pleaded guilty to the terrorism charges, Russian media reported. It was unclear what the fourth man, Faizov, born in 2004, pled. He was pictured lying limp in a wheelchair inside a glass cage.

The men looked beaten and injured as they were brought into the courtroom. Videos of them being battered while being detained and interrogated circulated widely on Russian social media. The four have been remanded into pre-trial detention until May 2022, the court said.

CNN asked the Kremlin about the “visible signs of violence” committed against the suspects, but spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused to comment.

Later Monday, Russia’s Investigative Committee asked the court to detain three other men – two brothers and their father – in connection with the attack, Russian state media TASS reported.

On Monday, three days after the attack, rescuers were still searching among the ruins of the collapsed concert hall and trying to clear rubble. Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said more than 300 “specialists” were working at the site.

The attack, the deadliest on Russian soil in almost two decades, was met with outrage and disbelief in Russia, prompting calls for the harshest of punishments to be meted out.

While the concert hall roof was still burning, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack and shared a video taken by the men as they stormed the building, where thousands of Russians had arrived to watch the rock group Picnic.

CNN has geolocated the 90-second video to the concert hall, where bodies and blood can be seen on the floor as fire rages above. The video also shows one of the attackers slitting the throat of a man lying on his back, and ends with the four attackers walking away inside the building with smoke rising in the distance.

Despite ISIS appearing to provide evidence that its fighters had carried out the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been keen to point the finger elsewhere.

In his only national address since the attack – more than 19 hours after it began – Putin on Saturday claimed that a “window” had been prepared for the attackers to escape to Ukraine. He did not provide evidence.

Other senior officials have sought to pin the blame on Ukraine for the attack. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: “Now we know in which country these bloody bastards planned to hide from persecution – Ukraine.”

Ukraine has vehemently denied any involvement and called the allegations a “planned provocation by the Kremlin to further fuel anti-Ukrainian hysteria in Russia society” and further mobilize Russian citizens to participate in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at historic lows, the United States warned Russia that ISIS militants were planning to stage an attack in the country. The US embassy in Moscow said earlier this month it was “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow,” including concerts.

US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienna Watson said the US had shared this information with Russian authorities under the “duty to warn” policy. The US also warned American citizens to avoid places like theaters and concert halls.

But in a speech Tuesday – just days before the attack – Putin dismissed the American warnings as “provocative,” saying “these actions resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society.”

Answering questions from reporters on Monday, Peskov refused to comment on whether Moscow had received warnings from Washington, and defended the “tireless work” of Russia’s security services.

Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian politics and security service the FSB, told CNN he thinks Putin “finds it hard to believe that the Americans, even with gritted teeth, would genuinely provide true intelligence about terrorist threats in the current environment.”

“Because he would have no qualms about issuing a fake intelligence warning in order to meddle with another country’s elections, I believe he may well have thought that in fact that’s what the Americans are doing,” Galeotti said.

A CNN team in Moscow spoke to mourners who had turned out to lay flowers for the victims of Friday’s attack.

Alexander Matveev, 37, told CNN that Russians feel insecure and worried that another attack could take place. He said he found Putin’s suggestion that Ukraine was involved to be plausible.

“He said they were trying to escape to Ukraine. This makes sense. They just found some halfwits who were eager for money,” Matveev said.",https://edition.cnn.com
13,"Who are ISIS-K, the group that claimed it carried out the Moscow terror attack?","CNN —

The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, claimed responsibly for Friday’s deadly assault on a concert venue in Moscow, releasing graphic footage purporting to show its gunmen carrying out what was Russia’s worst terror attack in decades.

Russian authorities have accused four men from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan of being behind the attack, which left at least 137 people dead and more than 100 injured. The suspects, who are charged with committing a terrorist act and face possible life imprisonment, have been remanded into pre-trial detention through May 22 after appearing in court in Moscow on Sunday.

US officials have tied the attack to the Islamic State in Khorasan, or ISIS-K, an ISIS affiliate that operates in central Asia, which has become one of the region’s most brutal and feared terror groups.

Since November, the US has received a stream of intelligence that ISIS-K was determined to mount an attack in Russia, sources told CNN, and passed those warnings on to Moscow. US Vice President Kamala Harris said Sunday that “what we know to be the case is that ISIS-K is actually, by all accounts responsible for what happened.”

Here’s what we know about ISIS-K.

Who are ISIS-K?

ISIS-K was formed in 2015 and has been active in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. It is a branch of ISIS, the terror group that emerged in Syria and Iraq and, at its peak, controlled a huge stretch of territory.

Five years since the fall of ISIS’ self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria, the group has morphed into a terror network with cells spread around the world, including in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.

The connection between ISIS-K and its apparent parent group is not entirely clear. The affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship – such as the chain of command and control – has never been fully established.

By 2018, ISIS-K was ranked the world’s fourth-deadliest terror group, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, which monitors global terrorism.

The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, and the withdrawal of US troops from the country, thrust ISIS-K into the global spotlight – especially after the group orchestrated a deadly bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 US military personnel and 170 Afghans.

It was ISIS-K’s most globally consequential action to date and drew a promise of retribution from US President Joe Biden.

The United Nations estimated in 2021 that the group has up to 2,200 core fighters based in Afghanistan’s Kunar and Nangarhar provinces.

Video Ad Feedback What we know about ISIS group claiming responsibility for Moscow terror attack 04:16 - Source: CNN

What do they want?

Like its parent organization, ISIS-K aims to create a “pure Islamic state,” according to CSIS – describing the group’s vision of a “global, transnational caliphate” governed by Sharia law.

ISIS-K has a mutual hatred of the Taliban and attracts those with views even more radical than the Islamist group that rules Afghanistan. It refuses to acknowledge the Taliban as a legitimate Islamic leader because it relies on a narrow base “instead of committing to a universal Islamic jihad,” according to CSIS.

As such, ISIS-K’s recent attacks have largely been aimed at the Taliban and other symbolic targets, as well as at Afghanistan’s Shia Muslim minorities, in particular the ethnic Hazaras.

The group’s hatred of the West, including the United States, Britain and Europe, also features prominently in their agenda – as does its enmity toward Russia.

Why did they attack Russia?

ISIS has a longstanding animosity against Russia and Putin, several experts told CNN.

“Russia has been at the top or near the top of the list of ISIS for many years,” said Daniel Byman, director of Georgetown University’s security studies program. He pointed to Moscow’s crucial role in the Syrian civil war, when it intervened in support of the Syrian government and against ISIS.

ISIS-K has also criticized the Taliban for being “too close to Russia,” Byman added.

There are other historical grievances, too. ISIS propaganda has long targeted Russia for its brutal tactics in the various Chechen wars, and its scorched-earth policies in the Caucasus affecting Eastern European and Eurasian Muslims, according to John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst.

In 2022, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide blast near Russia’s embassy in Kabul, which killed six people, including two consular staff.

Over the past month, Russia has thwarted several ISIS-related incidents, according to state-run news agency RIA Novosti. At least four incidents in March alone have been reported across Russia that local authorities said involved people connected to ISIS, RIA reported.

Russian state media reported on March 7 that the FSB, Russia’s security service, prevented an ISIS attack on a synagogue in Moscow, according to Reuters. The ISIS attackers were killed in a gunfight, the reports said.

What other attacks are they responsible for?

To date, the majority of ISIS-K’s most devastating attacks have been in Afghanistan and Pakistan – the Kabul airport blast being a prominent example.

Others include a May 2020 attack on a Kabul maternity ward that killed 24 people and an attack on Kabul University in November 2020 that killed 22, according to CSIS. ISIS-K was also believed to be behind a horrific car bombing outside a girls’ high school in May 2021 that killed at least 85 people.

The group was particularly active during its peak around 2018 – when an ISIS-K suicide bomber killed 128 people at an election rally in Mastung, Pakistan, one of the bloodiest attacks anywhere in the world that year.

While it’s no longer as strong as it was in 2018, ISIS-K continues to plan attacks in Afghanistan. It is the most active terror group in the country, responsible for 73 deaths in 2023, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace.

Could they pose a broader global threat?

The Kabul airport attack had raised global concerns that ISIS-K could pose a major threat across the region and beyond.

In March 2023, the head of the US Central Command told lawmakers that ISIS-K was becoming more emboldened, and that Europe or Asia were more likely targets for terrorist attacks originating in Afghanistan than the US.

In a 2023 threat assessment report by US intelligence agencies, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said ISIS-K “almost certainly retains the intent to conduct operations in the West and will continue efforts to attack outside Afghanistan.”

And earlier this year, the UN Security Council warned in a report that ISIS-K was planning or conducting “operational plots” in Europe. Seven people linked to the group were arrested in Germany last year while planning for “high-impact terrorist attacks,” including obtaining weapons and possible targets, the council said.

It is not the first time that ISIS has struck a concert venue. In November 2015, ISIS gunmen attacked the Bataclan theater in Paris – part of an assault that hit other targets in the city – killing at least 130 people. In May 2017, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena, England, that killed 22 people. ISIS has also inspired terrorists in the US, including the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 in what was then the most lethal terrorist attack in the US since 9/11.

Earlier this month, the US government had information about a planned terrorist attack in Moscow – potentially targeting large gatherings, to include concerts – which prompted the State Department to issue a public advisory to Americans in Russia. The US also shared this information with Russian authorities.

The intelligence that Washington had been getting since November was “fairly specific” and the US intelligence community warned Russia, but it’s not clear if this is directly tied to the March 7 warning by the US embassy in Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected the US embassy warnings about terror attacks as “provocative” in a speech to the FSB, saying they “resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society.”

Instead, Putin suggested Ukraine was behind the Crocus City attack – which Kyiv has vehemently denied.",https://edition.cnn.com
14,Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun to step down in wake of ongoing safety problems,"New York CNN —

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said Monday he intends to leave the beleaguered company by the end of the year in a major shakeup of the company’s leadership. Boeing’s chairman and the head of the commercial airplane unit are also leaving.

Boeing’s chairman, Larry Kellner, will not stand for re-election as a board director. The board has elected former Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf to succeed him.

The company also announced that Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is retiring. Stephanie Pope, Boeing’s chief operating officer since January, is taking his place effective immediately.

Boeing has been buffeted by more than five years of problems with its airplanes, including two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, and most recently a door plug that blew out of the side of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The problems have led to multiple groundings for safety issues and more than $31 billion in cumulative losses.

In a letter to Boeing employees Monday, Calhoun called the Alaska Airlines incident “a watershed moment for Boeing.”

“The eyes of the world are on us,” he said in announcing his departure plans. “We are going to fix what isn’t working, and we are going to get our company back on the track towards recovery and stability.”

The decision to leave was “100%” his choice, Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Monday morning.

But Calhoun has become the focus of many who are critical of the way Boeing has been run in recent decades and the string of safety and quality issues.

“He’s the very best CEO that Airbus has ever had,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst, recently referring to the advantages gained by Boeing’s main rival during his tenure running Boeing.

His departure also comes in the face of widespread criticism of the company by CEOs of many of the world’s major airlines Boeing depends upon to buy its planes. CEOs of numerous airlines had asked to speak directly to the Boeing board last week, which Calhoun tried to characterize Monday as a normal process, even if it’s rare for customers to speak directly to directors.

As to why Calhoun decided to stay on through the end of the year rather than leave immediately, he told CNBC: “We have another mountain to climb. Let’s not avoid what happened with Alaska Air. Let’s not avoid the call for action. Let’s not avoid the changes that we need to make in our factories.”

“We will get through that,” he said. “I’ve committed myself to the board to do exactly that.”

Airlines’ problems with Boeing

The airlines are upset both by the quality of the planes they are getting from Boeing, and the fact that Boeing won’t be able to deliver the planes they were counting on this year, as passenger demand continues to surge to record levels.

Michael O’Leary, CEO of Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline and one that flies only Boeing 737 planes, told CNN last week that whenever it takes deliveries of Boeing jets “we spend 48 hours going through the plane checking it for errors, omissions or anything else.”

And O’Leary said while it hasn’t found anything major in those checks, it regularly finds minor problems such as tools under floorboards and missing seat handles, that “shows, I think, a lack of attention to detail quality issues in Boeing.”

Monday Ryanair issued a statement saying, “We welcome these much-needed management changes in Seattle.”

United Airlines, which flies Boeing jets for more than 80% of its mainline fleet, has expressed disappointment in quality issues at Boeing and a delay in its scheduled deliveries.

The airline is a primary customer for a stretched version of the Boeing 737 Max, known as the Max 10, but Boeing’s inability to get the plane certified to carry passengers is also causing headaches.

Scott Kirby, CEO of United, described the Alaska Air incident as the “straw that broke the camel’s back” for its plans to get the Max 10 this year, as planned, and it is now looking at possibly buying jets from Boeing rival Airbus to take the place of the Max 10s it has ordered.

But it is difficult for airlines to shift to Airbus, which has a long backlog of jets it has already committed to build for its existing customer base. Any Boeing customer shifting to Airbus could find itself waiting until 2030 or beyond to get its planes delivered.

And operating two types of aircraft of the same class is costly, since pilots are certified to fly specific aircraft, and most cannot shift back and forth between an Airbus and a Boeing without training. And the airline needs to keep a supply of expensive spare parts on hand for every type of aircraft it operates.

Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci estimated recently it cost his airline $75 million to $100 million a year to operate both Airbus and Boeing single-aisle jets after it merged with Virgin America, and which is why it got rid of its Airbus jets after the merger was complete. And Alaska is a smaller national airline, only America’s fifth largest. Larger airlines face even greater costs from splitting fleets between manufacturers.

Facing numerous safety probes

The Boeing 737 Max 9 was grounded for three weeks after the Alaska Air incident as airlines completed inspections of their own planes’ door plugs. Minicucci disclosed that many of his planes were discovered to have loose bolts, although he did not mention missing bolts.

An audit of Boeing procedures by the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of the Alaska Air incident found numerous “non-compliance issues.” The agency gave the company 90 days to come up with a plan to fix its safety and quality issues.

But the probes at Boeing aren’t limited to the FAA audit. A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident found that the plane left the Boeing factory in October without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place. While the NTSB has not identified who is at fault for the missing bolts, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy criticized Boeing for not providing the agency with the documentation for who handled the installation of the door plug.

Calhoun told investors in January after the incident that “we caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.”

And Boeing is also facing an investigation by the Justice Department, which could open it up to criminal liability, and upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement the company reached in January 2021 to settle charges it defrauded the FAA during the original certification process for the 737 Max last decade. It was days away from having that probation-like period end when the Alaska Air incident happened.

The company has also had problems not related to the Max during Calhoun’s time in charge at Boeing, including a couple of halts in deliveries of the 787 Dreamliners, one of its main widebody jets, due to quality issues with that plane.

Finance, not engineering background

Calhoun, 66, a longtime board member at Boeing, became chairman of the company in late 2019, when the board stripped his predecessor Dennis Muilenburg of that title. He was tapped as CEO after Muilenburg was ousted in December of that year, starting in the job in January 2020.

Boeing was once known as a company that put engineering excellence ahead of financial performance, and produced planes that were the gold standard in the industry. Critics of the company say that focus has changed in the last 25 years, citing the 1997 merger with competitor McDonell Douglas for the shift in focus on saving money.

Calhoun is one of the executives since that time with no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, as well as CEO of Nielsen after 26 years at General Electric.

Calhoun’s tenure began about halfway through a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max due to a design flaw that was determined to have caused the two crashes; and just before the Covid pandemic broke out globally, causing a near halt in air travel and massive losses for the airlines Boeing depends upon to buy its planes.

Asked about what he would like to see in his successor, Calhoun told CNBC Monday that “I want somebody who knows how to handle a big, long, long-cycle business like ours. It’s not just the production of the airplane. It’s the development of the next airplane. It will be a $50 billion investment. I would like somebody who clearly has the experience inside our industry.”

Shares of Boeing, which have lost more than 27% of their value since the start of the year, jumped 4% in premarket trading on the news.

Brazilian soccer star Dani Alves has left prison after submitting a €1 million bond (approximately $1.08 million) to a Barcelona court required for his provisional release after being convicted of sexual assault, the Supreme Court of Justice of Catalonia said in a statement on Monday.

According to the court, Alves transferred the money into the account of Section 21 of the Provincial Court of Barcelona in Spain and the 40-year-old was later pictured leaving the Brians 2 penitentiary center. with his lawyer Inés Guardiola.

On February 22, the Barcelona provincial court sentenced Alves to four-and-a-half years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman in one of the city’s nightclubs in late December 2022.

Alves’ lawyer announced an appeal of the conviction and the sentence, while both the Barcelona Prosecutor’s Office and the plaintiff also announced their decision to appeal Alves’ provisional release.

After leaving prison, the 40-year-old will have his Brazilian and Spanish passports confiscated. He is also prohibited from leaving Spanish territory and must make weekly appearances at the provincial court.

As part of his release, Alves has a restraining order requiring him to stay at least one kilometer (roughly 0.6 miles) away from the plaintiff’s home, place of work or any location she tends to frequent. He is also barred from communicating with her via any means.

Alves is one of the most decorated soccer players of his generation, winning domestic titles in Spain, Italy and France. He won three Champions League titles with Barcelona in 2009, 2011 and 2015 and the Copa América with Brazil in 2007 and 2019.",https://edition.cnn.com
16,Uttar Pradesh: Court ruling effectively outlaws Islamic schools in India’s most populous state,"New Delhi CNN —

A court in India’s most populous state has effectively banned Islamic schools by striking down a law governing madrasas, weeks before a nationwide election that could further polarize the world’s largest democracy along religious lines.

The Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh on Friday declared the Madrasa Act of 2004 to be unconstitutional, according to a court order seen by CNN, while ordering the state government to move students enrolled in the Islamic system into mainstream schools.

“We hold that the Madarsa (sic) Act, 2004, is violative of the principle of Secularism, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India,” the high court said in its order.

“Since providing education is one of the primary duties of the State, it is bound to remain secular while exercising its powers in the said field. It cannot provide for education of a particular religion, its instructions, prescriptions and philosophies or create separate education systems for separate religions.”

Madrasas provide a system of education in which students are taught about the Quran and Islamic history alongside general subjects like math and science.

Some Hindus also send their children to an equivalent system known as Gurukuls, residential education institutions where students learn about ancient Vedic scriptures alongside general subjects under a “guru” or teacher.

The ruling can be appealed in the country’s Supreme Court.

Uttar Pradesh is home to some 200 million people, about 20% of whom are Muslim, according to the country’s most recent census data from 2011.

It is governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has over the past decade made headlines for passing some of the country’s most controversial laws that critics say discriminate against Muslims and marginalize them in the secular republic.

Friday’s court order affects 2.7 million students and 10,000 teachers in 25,000 madrasas, Reuters reported, citing Iftikhar Ahmed Javed, the head of the board of madrasa education in the state.

It comes weeks before a nationwide election - the world’s largest - during which an estimated 960 million people are eligible to vote.

Modi’s BJP is expected to secure another five years in power, ruling an India that has become increasingly polarized along religious lines.

While the Allahabad High Court order cited India’s constitutional separation of religion and state in its reasoning for ruling against madrasas, it is Modi who has been frequently accused by critics of dismantling India’s secular traditions.

At the start of the year, for example, Modi presided over a landmark inauguration ceremony of a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a centuries-old mosque that was destroyed by right-wing groups in 1992.

The temple’s opening, which was broadcast live by the government and hailed as a new era, was the conclusion of a decades-long campaign by Modi and his BJP party to pull India away from the secular roots upon which the country was founded following independence.

Many Muslims and critics of the BJP have raised concerns that India’s secular fabric is also being eroded as anti-Muslim hate speech make frequent headlines and Muslim-owned properties face demolitions.

The BJP denies it discriminates against Muslims and says it treats all citizens equally.

In December 2020, the northeastern state of Assam passed a law to convert all Islamic schools to regular education institutions.

The state’s then Education Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is now Assam’s chief minister, said it would ensure “a right to equal education for all children and eases the path to higher education.”

Opposition politicians criticized the move, claiming it was reflective of hardening anti-Muslim attitudes in the Hindu-majority country.

Senior state opposition leader Debabrata Saikia at the time said the law was passed by the BJP to “consolidate more Hindu votes.”",https://edition.cnn.com
17,Brazil flooding: At least 27 killed as relentless rain causes floods and landslides,"CNN —

At least 27 people have been killed in southeast Brazil as rainfall continues to ravage parts of the country, according to CNN affiliate CNN Brasil citing state authorities.

The death toll in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo rose to 19, and at least eight people have been killed in neighboring state Rio de Janeiro, CNN Brasil reported citing each state’s respective Civil Defense.

At least six people are still missing, and more than 7,000 people were forced to flee their homes in Espirito Santo, according to CNN Brasil.

Warnings for heavy rainfall are in place through Tuesday morning with lingering threats of scattered showers and storms over the region, according to the latest forecast predictions, where rainfall can potentially reach up to 50 millimeters (2 inches) per day through Tuesday.

There are higher rainfall chances and new flood potential in central Brazil through midweek, with daily rainfall potentially reaching 100 mm (4 inches) in 24 hours.

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva shared his condolences to those affected in a post on X on Saturday, saying “the federal government sympathizes with the affected families and lives lost and is in constant contact with state and municipal governments to protect, prevent and repair flood damage.”

Rescue operations are underway in both states, and residents are being urged to exercise caution, Rio de Janeiro Governor Claudio Castro and Espirito Santo Governor Renato Casagrande posted on X late last week.

Flooding and landslides remain one of the main concerns as rainfall has yet to cease through the week.

The climate crisis is helping to fuel more intense and more frequent rainfall events, and in Brazil this combines with rapid urbanization and often unsafe construction to deadly effect. More than 30 were killed after heavy rains last year in Rio Grande do Sul, while another 20 died in flooding in 2022 in Sao Paulo.

18,Biden administration to accuse Chinese hackers of targeting US companies in espionage campaign,"The Biden administration is preparing to publicly accuse several Chinese hackers of conducting sweeping hacks against US companies on behalf of China’s civilian intelligence service, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.

The multi-agency crackdown is expected to include criminal charges, sanctions and a multimillion-dollar reward for information on the hackers, whom the US government alleges operate at the behest of China’s powerful Ministry of State Security spy agency, the sources said.

An announcement identifying the hackers with names and photos is expected as soon as Monday, the sources said. The hackers have been using a Chinese technology company as a front to cover their hacking activity, one of the sources said. The British government is also preparing to accuse the hacking group of targeting UK organizations, the sources said.

CNN has requested comment from the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC. The Justice Department declined to comment for this story.

The moves would come at a particularly delicate time in US-China cyber relations, weeks after FBI Director Christopher Wray issued a dire public warning that a different group of Chinese hackers was preparing “to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to strike.”

At a meeting in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US election — an assurance that US officials are not taking at face value, CNN previously reported.

Beijing has vigorously denied the US allegations of hacking and in turn accused the US of conducting its own hacking operations against China.

The US announcement expected this week will focus on alleged Chinese cyber-espionage instead of the possible disruptive cyberattacks highlighted by Wray, according to the sources briefed on the matter.

The US is expected to identify several Chinese men as working for a Wuhan-based technology company that conducts hacking operations on behalf of the MSS, China’s civilian spy agency. The cybersecurity industry knows the hacking group as APT31 or Judgement Panda, and researchers have found the hackers targeting everything from US law firms to European industrial organizations to international apparel companies.

Ahead of the 2020 US election, hackers associated with the group had unsuccessfully tried to break into email accounts of people affiliated with the Biden campaign, according to Microsoft. It was not immediately clear whether any of the men expected to be named this week were allegedly involved in that activity.

The announcement this week wouldn’t be the first time that the Chinese government’s extensive cyber capabilities have been traced back to contractors working for front companies.

A trove of documents leaked last month from another Chinese tech firm, I-Soon, showed victims of the firm’s hacking from Tibet to Hong Kong. Clients listed in contracts with the firm included China’s police, intelligence service and military, according to the leaked data.",https://edition.cnn.com
19,‘Extraordinary’ archive of ancient brains could help shed light on mental illness,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

An undertaker turned academic, Alexandra Morton-Hayward became interested in brains — specifically how they decompose — during her former job.

“I worked for years with the dead. My own experience is that the brain is pretty quick to liquefy (postmortem),” she said. “So it was a real shock when I came across a (scientific) paper referencing a 2,500-year-old brain.”

Now a forensic anthropologist studying for a doctorate at the University of Oxford, Morton-Hayward has discovered that brains, while not as commonly found intact as bones, do preserve surprisingly well in the archaeological record.

To understand why, the anthropologist has compiled a unique archive of information about 4,405 brains unearthed by archaeologists. Brains have surfaced from northern European peat bogs, Andean mountaintops, shipwrecks, desert tombs and Victorian poorhouses. The earliest discovered were 12,000 years old.

Morton-Hayward is primarily working toward understanding how these brains survive the ravages of time, with at least four preservation mechanisms at play.

However, the database also will open whole new areas of study, said Martin Wirenfeldt Nielsen, a senior physician and pathologist at South Denmark University Hospital, who wasn’t involved in the research. He’s also in charge of the University of Southern Denmark’s medical brain collection.

“This database will enable scientists to study brain tissue from ancient times and determine whether diseases known today were also present many years ago in civilizations completely different from the ones we currently live in,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said via email.

“Examining tissue from brains that have not been exposed to the environment and stimuli in modern society might help us understand whether some of the brain diseases we encounter today could be at least in part caused by the way we live now.”

A collection of ancient brains

Morton-Hayward scoured scientific literature going back three centuries and interviewed historians and archaeologists to catalog the brains. However, not all the corresponding physical specimens are still available for study.

The oldest were two 12,000-year-old brains reported from a site in Russia in the 1920s, which researchers described as being found with woolly mammoth teeth, Morton-Hayward said. It’s not clear what happened to the brains, she added.

Morton-Hayward works in a lab in Oxford, England, where she has helped build a collection of 570 ancient brains. They are kept in fridges in jars and takeout-style plastic containers because they have secure lids. The oldest specimen in the lab is an 8,000-year-old brain from Stone Age Sweden, which was mounted on a spike before burial in a lakebed.

Morton-Hayward and her colleagues identified four ways the brains, typically discolored and shrunken, had been preserved — factors often linked to the climate or environment in which they were found. The results were published March 19 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences.

Dry, hot conditions dehydrated the brains in a way that mimics the deliberate embalming of mummies, while in acidic peat bogs the body was essentially tanned like leather. In cold places, the brain was frozen, while in a few cases, fats found in the brain transformed into “grave wax,” a process known as saponification.

However, in around 1,328 cases, brains survived in the absence of other soft tissues, prompting questions as to why this organ may persist while others decompose. Interestingly, many of the oldest brains are preserved in this unknown way, Morton-Hayward said.

“We have this fifth mechanism, this unknown mechanism which we hypothesize could be a form of molecular crosslinking, possibly promoted by the presence of metals like iron,” she said, referring to the possibility that proteins and lipids in the brain fuse in the presence of elements such as iron or copper, allowing the brain to be preserved.

The researchers don’t believe the skull’s protective shell is behind the preservation of the brain in the absence of other soft tissue because preserved brains had been found in skulls damaged from trauma or the fossilization process, according to the study.

“Tissue from the central nervous system is extremely fragile and vulnerable and discovering that brain tissue has been preserved for so many years is extraordinary,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said.

Shown here is the 1,000-year-old brain of a person excavated from the c. 10th century churchyard of Sint-Maartenskerk, in Ypres, Belgium. The folds of the tissue, which are still soft and wet, are stained orange with iron oxides. Alexandra L. Morton-Hayward

Secrets waiting to be spilled?

It’s possible ancient DNA and proteins could be teased out from the brains — spilling secrets about the people to which they once belonged. If successfully recovered, the material potentially may be able to reveal things that molecular information extracted from bones and teeth cannot, Morton-Hayward said.

“The brain is the most metabolically active (organ) in the human body. It’s 2% of our body weight, but consumes 20% of our energy, constantly doing things. It’s an incredibly complex organ, and therefore it has this really unusual biomolecular composition. So the kind of wealth of information is just that much greater to begin with,” she said.

“Ancient DNA could be preserved really well within these brains because of the way in which, at least brains of the unknown type, appear to be preserving,” she added. “They’re condensing and shrinking and driving out the water. And that’s forming this kind of closed system that could in theory, protect high-quality, high-yield DNA.”

Many of the people the brains belonged to have exciting stories deserving of more attention, Morton-Hayward said. One of the brains she documented belonged to a Polish saint. Another was the victim of an Inca sacrifice. As a former undertaker, she said she never forgets the humans behind the body parts.

“I’m so grateful for having that experience,” she said. “The most important thing is that you never lose sight of the fact that these samples they are human beings.”",https://edition.cnn.com
20,"Olivia Colman says if she were a man, she’d be earning ‘a f**k of a lot more’","London CNN —

British actress Olivia Colman has hit out at the gender pay gap, declaring that she would be paid “a f**k of a lot more” if she were a man.

The star, who won an Oscar in 2019 for her leading role as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “The Favourite,” made the claim in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.

There to discuss her current film, “Wicked Little Letters,” together with the movie’s director, Thea Sharrock, Colman, 50, suggested there could be no justification for paying women less than men.

She was responding to a question that Amanpour posed to Sharrock, asking whether female actors are now considered “big box office draws.”

Sharrock said “I would say yes,” before Colman cut in to say: “Research suggests that they have always been big box office draws, but they have chosen to say…”

Colman, who played Queen Elizabeth II in seasons three and four of “The Crown,” then paused briefly, adding: “Don’t get me started on the pay disparity.”

Clearly passionate about the subject, she continued: “Male actors get paid more because they used to say they draw in the audiences, but actually that hasn’t been true for decades. But they still like to use that as a reason to not pay women as much as their male counterparts. Particularly in our industry.”

Amanpour then went on to ask: “Do you have a pay disparity? I mean you’re an Oscar-winning actress, Olivia?”

Without hesitation, Colman replied: “I’m very aware that if I was Oliver Colman I would be earning a f**k of a lot more than I am.”

Reacting with surprise, Amanpour asked: “Really?” Colman replied: “Absolutely, yes.”

She said she was “aware of one (example of) pay disparity that is a 12,000% difference,” though she didn’t name the individuals involved.

Colman and Sharrock, who also directed the 2016 weepie “Me Before You,” starring Emilia Clarke, were there to discuss their new comedy about a poison pen letter scandal that rocked an English seaside town a century ago.

It tells of a young Irish newcomer to the town - played by Jessie Buckley - who is accused of sending out a series of coarsely worded poison pen letters to the town’s conservative residents.

When asked if there was a lot of swearing on set, Sharrock said: “Olivia is incredibly potty-mouthed,” before adding “We all are.”

“I think it’s a nice seasoning of language,” said Colman, who added that she tended to swear more when nervous.

When asked what her favorite curse word is, Colman said: “American audiences really aren’t keen on my favorite word.”

The word itself was bleeped out, though Colman tried to justify it by saying: “I do maintain that it is actually quite a cultured word because Chaucer used it.”",https://edition.cnn.com
21,"Digital Markets Act: Apple, Google and Meta at risk of ‘heavy’ fines as Europe launches new probes","London CNN —

The European Union has launched investigations into Apple, Google and Facebook parent Meta on suspicion that they are failing to comply with a new landmark European law designed to promote competition in digital services.

The European Commission said it “suspects” that various practices by all three companies “fall short of effective compliance” with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which went into effect earlier this month. If the probes find a “lack of full compliance,” they could face “heavy fines,” said European Commissioner Thierry Breton.

The DMA requires dominant online platforms to give users more choices and rivals more opportunities to compete. It currently applies to the three tech giants under investigation, as well as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.

By mid-May, the list could also include Elon Musk’s X and Booking.com, the EU has said.

Violations of the new law can lead to stiff penalties, including fines of up to 10% of a company’s global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. For most of the regulated companies, that would translate to tens of billions of dollars.

The practices the European Commission is investigating include what it calls Meta’s “pay or consent” approach. Last October, Meta (META) launched a subscription service, called “Subscription for no ads,” allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to €12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions.

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by (large companies),” the body said in a statement.

A Meta spokesperson responded: “Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed ‘Subscription for no ads’ to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission.”

The EU is also looking into app stores operated by Apple (AAPL) and Google. The DMA states that large digital platforms — so-called gatekeepers — must allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the two dominant stores, free of charge.

Among other concerns, the EU suspects that Apple and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL) constrain developers’ ability “to freely communicate (with end-users) and promote offers and directly conclude contracts, including by imposing various charges,” the Commission said.

“We are concerned Alphabet, Apple & Meta & are not meeting their obligations, e.g.: Apple & Alphabet still charge recurring fees to app developers,” European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager wrote on X Monday.

Apple’s “choice screen” for Safari is also under scrutiny, the European Commission said. Under the DMA, Apple must prompt users with “choice screens which must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones,” it noted.

Apple told CNN in a statement: “We’re confident our plan complies with the DMA, and we’ll continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.”

Another of the Commission’s concerns pertains to Google Search. Alphabet may not have done enough to ensure that third-party services appearing in search results are treated in “a fair and non-discriminatory manner” compared with Alphabet’s own services, such as Google Shopping and Google Flights.

Oliver Bethell, a competition executive at Google, said in a statement: “To comply with the Digital Markets Act, we have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe.

“We have engaged with the European Commission, stakeholders and third parties in dozens of events over the past year to receive and respond to feedback, and to balance conflicting needs within the ecosystem. We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.”

22,Stuart Webber: Former soccer club official criticized for ‘lazy stereotyping’ of Black players,"CNN —

A former official at soccer clubs in England and Wales has been accused by an anti-racism body of stereotyping Black players with “callous language.”

Stuart Webber, who left his role as sporting director of Norwich City last year, made the comments in reference to five Black players he had worked with – Jonny Rowe, Abu Kamara, Max Aarons, Jamal Lewis and Raheem Sterling – while speaking with The Pink Un, a regional newspaper in the city of Norwich.

Webber’s comments came during an interview about his upcoming four-week expedition to climb Mount Everest for charity.

“We want to help the guys who really need it, not the ones who are maybe privileged,” he said, adding: “Where [the players] come from, it had to work out for them in football because the alternative is potentially jail or something else.”

The comments have been widely condemned, with sports anti-discrimination body Kick It Out describing them as “racial profiling” and “deeply offensive and concerning” on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“To read such callous language being used by someone who until recently was a senior executive at the top of the English game paints a very damning picture,” Kick It Out said.

“Resorting to lazy stereotyping is clearly upsetting for those who have been targeted, but also shows a complete lack of respect for their families, who have played a huge part in the journeys that the players have been on.”

CNN has attempted to contact Webber for comment.

Webber and his wife Zoe are co-founders of the Summit Foundation, which works with other charitable organizations to create programs to help young people. According to the foundation’s website, one of its aims is to help break the poverty cycle through education.

“We have to give the young people in this area something to strive for, to inspire them and, if we can, give them financial support,” he told The Pink Un. “Post-Everest, we’ll continue the charity work.”

In a statement on X, Kamara – a striker who plays for League One team Portsmouth on loan from Norwich City – said that he and his family are “deeply saddened and shocked” by Webber’s remarks.

He added: “I want to say to all the black and ethnic minority children, you don’t have to be a professional athlete to avoid living a life of crime and it is important that younger audiences are not left with this false narrative.

“I am proud of where I come from and acknowledge the sacrifices my family have made in order for me to have a career in football. These remarks are a sign that there is still a long way to go to be treated equally.”

Also writing on X, Aarons’ mother, Amber, said that there was “not a chance any of those boys … would have been in jail,” while Lewis’ mother, Catrina, said that Webber’s remarks were “very unprofessional.”

In a statement on Monday, Norwich said that Webber’s comments “do not in any way reflect the wider views of the football club,” adding: “Following publication of the interview, club representatives have focused on speaking directly with Abu Kamara and Jonathan Rowe to understand their concerns and offer support.

“The club are also in the process of reaching out to the other named players, whilst also engaging in dialogue with Kick It Out.

“Norwich City is a home for everyone. We remain committed in our work across equality, diversity and inclusion to create an environment where all can feel welcome and valued.”

23,This Italian town is struggling to sell off its empty homes for one euro. Here’s why,"CNN —

Italy’s one-euro-home sales have been attracting a lot of interest over the past few years, with dozens opting to snap up abandoned properties in some of the country’s depopulated towns.

But while towns like Mussomeli in Sicily and Zungoli in Campania have managed to offload various abandoned dwellings to foreigners longing to live the Italian dream, some have struggled to sell their empty homes.

Among them is Patrica, a remote medieval village of barely 3,000 residents located south of Rome, where more than 40 properties deserted in the early 1900s have been left to rot.

Perched on a rocky plateau overlooking the Sacco valley in central Italy, Patrica is an idyllic spot, but life here wasn’t easy for locals in the past.

Abandoned homes

Many left in search of a brighter future elsewhere, leaving their homes empty for decades.

In an attempt to breathe new life into the dying village, the town’s mayor Lucio Fiordaliso has been trying to emulate the success of other Italian villages who’ve put their empty homes up for sale for one euro, or just over a dollar. He’s so far had little success.

“We first mapped all abandoned houses and made an official call out to the original owners to invite them to hand over their dilapidated family properties, but we managed to sell just two homes for one euro,” Fiordaliso tells CNN.

While local authorities in towns left underpopulated due to earthquakes and other natural calamities have the jurisdiction to put abandoned homes up for sale without permission from the owners, this isn’t the case for Patrica and other towns like it.

“We first need the availability of owners, or their heirs, in disposing of their old houses,” says Fiordaliso.

“Only then can we place these properties up for sale with their consent, which makes the process very complicated. Almost impossible.”

Fiordaliso explains that the town received a “positive response” from 10 owners after sending out a “public call to involve them in our one-euro-homes project,” but they withdrew at the last minute. The rest never replied.

Public call

Many of the town's local families left in search of a brighter future elsewhere, leaving their homes empty for decades. Comune di Patrica

Fiordaliso feels that those who changed their minds may have done so because of issues with other relatives who owned shares of the same property.

Abandoned buildings in old Italian towns are sometimes split between multiple heirs who own just a section – like a bathroom, balcony, kitchen - and nothing can be sold without written consent from all heirs, as per Italian law.

In the past, it was customary for children to inherit parts of their family home, including patches of land, wells and orchards.

But it’s not always a guarantee that relatives will still be on good terms and/or in contact years down the line.

“The disposal of potential one euro homes faced a deadlock as most relatives sharing the same property were at odds with one another for personal reasons or couldn’t agree on the sale, some hardly spoke or knew each other, others lived in distant cities and even abroad,” says the mayor.

In some instances, homes were never officially split between heirs in the past, so the ownership line had broken along the way without a clear indication as to who should be the current owner.

According to Fiordaliso, tracking down the descendants of owners who’d long migrated overseas, mainly to the US, Canada and Argentina and perhaps had different last names, or may have passed on their Italian property to foreigners without notifying Patrica’s town hall, has been a very hard task.

“It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack,” he adds.

The only two abandoned homes that Patrica managed to sell as part of its one-euro scheme were fully owned by two locals, so no liaising with fourth-degree cousins or great-great-grandsons was required, and they could sell the properties without any complications.

Family ties

The remote medieval village has a population of around 3,000. Comune di Patrica

In situations where family feuds are at play, relatives could choose not to sell their share due to legal issues tied to inheritance disputes, or even as a form of revenge.

And original owners who’ve been living elsewhere for many years may be wary of making themselves known to local authorities and potentially being hit with back taxes for their property and waste disposal charges of up to 2,500 euros (around $2,730 per year, plus unpaid utility bills

Another reason that the one euro scheme never really kicked off in Patrica could be due to the condition of its forsaken homes.

Some of the houses are simply too neglected to sell, even if the owners were willing to agree to it.

Patrica local Gianni Valleco and his two brothers decided to place their parents’ abandoned home on the market to see what would happen, but soon found that the house was far from desirable.

“We thought, ‘Why not give it a go’? Even if it’s just for one euro, we’d be rid of a heap of useless stones. We were curious to see if someone might be interested anyway in buying it,” says Valleco.

“We were aware that after half a century our parents’ home had turned into rubble, it was totally destroyed, like razed to the ground.

“The roof and most walls had collapsed, leaving an open-air room covered in grass and bushes. All there remained was a patch of land, an ugly garden right in the heart of the historical center.”

According to Valleco, a neighbor had been using what remained of the home to dump their old stuff.

“We then realized nobody would ever buy it,” he says. “It’s a bad investment requiring lots of money to rebuild the house. It’s more worth buying a tiny rural cottage in the surroundings.”

Thankfully, not all of the deserted homes in Patrica that could be potentially sold for one euro are in quite such a terrible state, and some have garnered interest from potential buyers.

“A few foreigners came to see the abandoned one-euro dwellings. There was lots of interest but unfortunately we had nothing to offer them,” says the mayor, adding that those interested were from the US and Europe.

In the meantime, Fiordaliso has been coming up with new ways to boost the town’s appeal in the hope of luring newcomers.

New scheme

The town hall recently funded the makeover of the external façades of some ancient palazzos, prompting several locals to entirely restyle their old family homes and put them to use after decades of neglect.

Local resident Alessandra Pagliarosi took things a step further by turning the 1950s mansion inherited by her husband into an elegant B&B called Patricia.

“We redid the roof, which was practically no longer there, and the interior. The mayor’s move finally gave us a good excuse to fully renovate the property which had been sitting there uselessly,” says Pagliarosi, who benefited from the new tax breaks introduced by the town hall to revive the local economy.

Those who decide to kickstart a commercial activity like an B&B or artisan boutique in the ancient district are exempt from paying taxes on waste disposal, advertisement and public space use for 10 years and granted tax credits for restructuring costs.

“For a small B&B, that would amount to a total of roughly 1,200 euros (around $1,310) per year in tax savings, which is a significant amount of money,” says Pagliarosi.

Foreigners planning to relocate to Patrica and launch a small business are also entitled to the tax benefits.

So far, two new B&Bs and one restaurant have opened up as a result.

Local realtor Ilario Grossi, who runs Immobil Lepini estate agency, located in the nearby town of Ceccano, says several American descendants of emigrant families recently visited Patrica to look at properties.

But the town’s ready-to-occupy homes, with two-bedroom properties starting at 20,000 euros ($21,832,) proved to be more appealing.

“There is interest, but then when many (foreigners) actually see the bad shape of the old homes they’d prefer to opt for turn-key apartments that are already restyled or in need of just minor fixes,” says Grossi.

“So it’s much more convenient to buy one of these newer ones than grab an old building in need of a major renovation, where the final cost would end up being much higher.”

Despite these challenges, Fiordaliso hasn’t given up on selling some of the town’s long neglected homes, even if it means having to negotiate between warring relatives.",https://edition.cnn.com
24,"Alex Honnold, Hazel Findlay and Mikey Shaefer: How three cilmbers scaled one of the world’s largest unclimbed rock faces","CNN —

In a world now hyper connected by technology, transport links and our smartphone screens, there are few places that can truly be described as untouched. But for climber Alex Honnold, some such places, found in the harshest and most unforgiving of environments, still exist and are ripe for adventure.

Honnold had palms sweating and pulses racing when he climbed Yosemite’s 3,200 foot granite monolith El Capitan without any safety ropes – a mind-boggling achievement immortalized in the breathtaking BAFTA and Oscar winning National Geographic documentary “Free Solo.”

Following the success of the film and his rise to stardom, Honnold set his sights on Ingmikortilaq, a formidable and unclimbed 3,750-foot rock wall jutting from Greenland’s frigid icy waters. The steep rock is more than double the height of the Empire state building.

“I’m never going to do another climbing project that goes to the Oscars, you know? I can just set that expectation aside and I can focus on the projects that I’m excited about, that I’m inspired by,” he tells CNN Sport.

The 38-year-old athlete, alongside pro climbers Hazel Findlay and Mikey Shaefer, ventured to the formidable seacliff, known locally as “the separate one,” in a six-week expedition that featured in National Geographic’s documentary “Arctic Ascent.”

Honnold has done many first ascents all over the world, but says, that he’d “never done a first ascent of that magnitude, of a wall of that size.”

Taking on one of the world’s biggest unscaled walls might be the stuff of dreams for any climber, but the conditions, less so: Honnold and his team were forced to battle unpredictable weather, snow storms, tumbling loose rock and delayed delivery of their climbing equipment.

In spite of his reputation, Honnold is not entirely unflappable, describing sea cliff Ingmikortilaq as “pretty intimidating” and “daunting,” due to the swirling rock changing in rock type and quality.

“The first time we saw the wall from the boat, we all were pretty, you know, we’re like, ‘Oh, no, that’s a lot’,” he says.

Findlay, who took on the first ascent alongside Honnold, tells CNN even with careful planning and a TV crew, the team faced a surprising number of “unknowns,” not least the pressure and expectation they felt of working on the documentary.

“I think as a climber, you kind of get used to going into things with that level of unknown. I don’t know if you can really have an adventure without unknowns, that’s definitely just part of the experience,” Findlay explains.

“But when you’re making it for a TV show, there’s this added pressure: you really do kind of have to succeed or otherwise that money gets wasted and people’s jobs are on the line.”

After weeks of traveling to the cliff with a team including glaciologist Dr. Heïdi Sevestre, Greenlandic guide Adam Kjeldsen and adventurer Aldo Kane, the climbers set their sights on the formidable buttress.

“That wall was just really loose, it was just a lot harder to manage the risks, we felt like we could do everything possible to make it safe, and it still could be too dangerous,” Findlay adds.

Honnold explains he approached the six-week expedition and “almost overwhelming challenge” of the climb the same way he does all his projects: “breaking things down into things that are manageable.”

He adds: “I think a big part of doing things that other people find scary is broadening your comfort zone to the point that things that you used to think were scary are just no longer scary.

“That has meant consistently scaring myself in different ways, consistently doing things that are a small step beyond what I felt comfortable with before.”

He adds that 10 years ago, many aspects of the expedition would have been very scary for him.

“If you do something routinely for 20 years, it’s just not that scary. I think a lot of viewers see that and they’re like, ‘Oh, he lives a normal life like I do, and then every once in a while he does things like this’.

“No, no, this is what I do five days a week, all year round for the last 20 years,” he chuckles.

Warnings from a warming planet

Before making it to Ingmikortilaq, the team collected data to help inform a “health check” of Eastern Greenland, which hadn’t been completed in some 20 years.

The team studied glaciers, icebergs, fjord waters, and rock faces with the aim of increasing our knowledge of the impact climate change is having on this vital, fragile part of our planet, which will have ultimately have reverberations across the world.

This included a climb up a 1,500-foot rock face, known as the Pool Wall, to take real-time depth and density measurements of a rarely studied section of Greenland’s ice cap.

“Behind these really cool walls, we did some useful science. That is win, win, all the way across the world,” Honnold explains.

“So much of modern science just has to do with access: if you can get the right person to the right place, they can make meaningful contributions to science with relatively little effort,” he adds.

Sevestre tells CNN that the Arctic is currently warming three to four times faster than the rest of the world.

“By being able to better understand what’s happening to Greenland, this helps us to provide better data and better projections on how the rest of the world could be impacted by Arctic changes,” she explains.

A recent study from the California Institute of Technology found that the Greenland ice sheet is losing an average of 30 million metric tons of ice an hour on average, as a result of human-caused global warming.

Sevestre explains that “our present and our future is intimately connected to Greenland.”

The island holds enough ice to increase sea levels by six to seven meters, adding that cities like London, New York and Miami are on the “front line,” she adds.

“And at the moment, we have a choice: do we continue investing in fossil fuels as much as we are today? If we want to give a chance to Greenland and give a chance to our own collective future, we really need to think long and hard about how much we want it.”

“We’re just agreeing passively to invest more and more into fossil fuels. But we really need to understand how high the stakes really are. We could totally get a meter of sea level rise by 2070.

“I mean, this is tomorrow for the younger generations,” she adds.

25,Barcelona’s famous Sagrada Familia will finally be completed in 2026,"CNN —

The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona will finally be finished in 2026, more than 140 years after construction started, officials have confirmed.

The construction of the last of six towers will mark the completion of the structure of the basilica, the organization responsible for managing the site announced last week.

“The Chapel of the Assumption is expected to be finished in 2025 and the tower of Jesus Christ, in 2026,” the Sagrada Familia said in a statement announcing the publication of its 2023 annual report.

The tower of Jesus Christ will stand at 172.5 meters (566 feet) tall, and will be finished with a 17-meter-tall (56-foot) four-armed cross, according to the cathedral.

When complete, the Sagrada Familia will become the world’s tallest church, overtaking Ulm Minster in Germany.

Construction began in 1882 according to a design spearheaded by celebrated Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, who decided the monumental structure would have 18 huge, spindle-shaped towers, each symbolizing a different biblical figure—the 12 apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary and Jesus.

When Gaudí died in 1926, only an estimated 10%-15% of the project had been built, including one transept, a crypt and some of the apse wall.

Construction, already slow, was interrupted in the late 1930s by the Spanish Civil War, when most of the designs and models of Gaudí— whose tomb lies beneath the cathedral—were destroyed.

Current designs are based on surviving and reconstructed materials, as well as reimagined adaptations of the original.

In 1984, the building was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, and it was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI for religious worship in 2010.

The construction of the church was carried out illegally for 137 years, until 2019, when a building permit was finally issued by Barcelona’s city council. Authorities only discovered the “anomaly” that it had never been granted planning permission in 2016.",https://edition.cnn.com
26,Timeline of the Supreme Court’s mifepristone abortion pill ruling,"CNN —

The fate of the abortion pill lies with the Supreme Court.

The high court, which has a conservative supermajority, holds the power to maintain full access to the drug or reverse regulation changes that made medication abortion more accessible in recent years. This includes allowing the pills to be prescribed via telemedicine, delivered in the mail and used up to 10 weeks of pregnancy instead of seven.

In a lawsuit brought after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a federal judge in Texas ruled to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone — one of two pills used in most medication abortions. The drug is still fully available while the Supreme Court deliberates.

Medication abortion accounts for nearly two-thirds of all US abortions, according to 2023 data from the Guttmacher Institute. At least 5.9 million women have used mifepristone since its FDA approval in 2000. It is also often prescribed for miscarriage treatment.

See a timeline of mifepristone access since it was approved in 2000:

Mifepristone’s safety is well-established. Data analyzed by CNN shows it is safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, such as penicillin and Viagra. It also comes with a lower risk of serious complications than the alternatives: procedural abortion and childbirth. Telehealth for medication abortion is also effective and safe, according to a recent study.",https://edition.cnn.com
27,Poland demands explanation after accusing Russia of violating its airspace,"CNN —

Poland has demanded an explanation from Moscow after saying a Russian cruise missile aimed at Ukraine entered its territory.

“On March 24 at 4:23 a.m., there was a violation of Polish airspace by one of the cruise missiles launched tonight by the long-range aviation of the Russian Federation,” the Operational Command of the Polish armed forces said on X.

“The object flew into Polish [air]space near the village of Oserdow (Lublin Voivodeship) and spent 39 seconds in it,” Operational Command said. “It was observed by military radar systems throughout its flight.”

The report came after Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched about 20 missiles and seven Shahed attack drones targeting the western Ukrainian region of Lviv, which is near the Polish border. There were also multiple explosions reported in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

The head of the Lviv regional military administration, Maksym Kozytskyi, said that Russia hit Ukrainian critical infrastructure in the western Lviv region.

“Preliminarily, there were two hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the invaders had targeted overnight,” Kozytskyi said on Telegram.

Operational Command said on X that both Polish and allied aircraft had been activated.

“All necessary procedures to ensure the security of Polish airspace have been activated,” the Command added.

“The Polish Military is continuously monitoring the situation on Ukrainian territory and remains on constant alert to ensure the safety of Polish airspace,” it said.

The last time Russia violated Poland’s airspace was on December 29, 2023. The Polish military said at the time “an unidentified airborne object” had entered its airspace from Ukrainian territory, and later Poland’s most senior military officer said “all indications” suggested it was a Russian missile.

Poland’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Pawel Wronski, said in a statement on Sunday that the country called on Russia “to stop terrorist attacks from the air on the residents and territory of Ukraine, and to end the war and deal with the country’s internal problems.”

Meanwhile, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that a series of blasts had occurred in the Ukrainian capital, with missile fragments falling in the Desnianskyi district.

“Explosions in the capital. Air defense is active. Do not leave your shelters,” Klitschko said.

He added that fire and rescue units were heading to the scene.

28,"Kaduna, Nigeria: 137 school children kidnapped by gunmen released, state governor says","CNN —

At least 137 school children who were kidnapped by armed gunmen in Nigeria earlier this month have been released, the governor of Nigeria’s Kaduna state Uba Sani confirmed in a TV interview aired on Sunday.

In the interview broadcast on Nigeria’s Channels Television, Sani said he had met with the children’s families.

“I am happy, the families are happy, we are all happy the children have been rescued,” he told the broadcaster.

However, Sani said that a teacher had died after developing “some complications” while in captivity, without providing further detail.

On March 7, more than 300 students were abducted by armed bandits on motorcycles who stormed the LEA Primary and Secondary School in Kuriga village, in Kaduna’s Chikun district, state police told CNN at the time.

Kaduna state, which borders the Nigerian capital Abuja to the southwest, has grappled with recurring incidents of kidnappings for ransom by bandits and has witnessed several mass abductions in recent years.

In an earlier post on X, Sani was seen addressing dozens of children and wrote that he was “glad to see our released children in high spirits on Sunday evening.”

He wrote that they would continue to “undergo psychosocial counseling” and receive “proper medical supervision.”

The gunmen previously demanded a ransom of 1 billion naira ($620,000) and threatened to kill all of the students if their demands were not met, according to a member of the community.

Nigeria’s National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu had coordinated the “operations of the security agencies, which eventually resulted in this successful outcome,” Sani said.

“The Nigerian Army also deserves special commendation for showing that with courage, determination and commitment, criminal elements can be degraded and security restored in our communities,” Sani said.

He also thanked Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu for “working round the clock” to ensure the children’s safe return.

South Korean soccer star Son Jun-ho, who was detained in China for allegedly accepting bribes, has recently returned home, the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Monday.

The ministry has been communicating with the Chinese authorities through “various channels” and requested cooperation to “ensure a swift and fair process,” it said without giving details of the release.

Son was detained by public security authorities in China’s northeast Liaoning province last May “on suspicion of taking bribes as a person who is not a functionary of a state organ.”

Son is a midfielder for Shandong Taishan, a soccer club in the Chinese Super League (CSL) which won the 2021 league title and more recently the 2022 Chinese Football Association Cup.

He has also represented South Korea’s men’s national team and reached the knockout stages of the World Cup in 2022 with the squad.

Son became the first foreign soccer player to be investigated and detained since the CSL started in 2004, according to China’s state-run Global Times.

His arrest was part of a broader initiative by Beijing to rid Chinese soccer of alleged corruption in the highest levels of the sport, during which the Communist Party’s anti-graft watchdog has been investigating a host of Chinese Football Association figures.",https://edition.cnn.com
30,Spring storm brings heavy snow to Plains and Midwest and threatens tornadoes in South,"CNN —

A powerful storm is pummeling parts of the Plains with blizzard conditions as it drops a blanket of snow from Colorado to Minnesota through Tuesday, threatening widespread power outages and treacherous road conditions. The wide-reaching storm will also fire up severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in classic springtime fashion.

The storm is the latest in a series that have blurred the transition from winter to spring. Some cities, like Minneapolis St.-Paul, have received more snow in the past week than they had all winter. And parts of New England, where tens of thousands remain without power, endured a bigger snowstorm this weekend than any single storm this winter.

Blizzard warnings extend from northern Colorado and Kansas into parts of Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota on Monday. Between 2 and 10 inches of snow could fall in these areas, and some places could see more than a foot, according to the National Weather Service.

Travel could become “nearly impossible” in some areas as the storms move through the Plains and Upper Midwest, creating icy roadways and whiteout conditions, the weather service warned.

Freezing rain and sleet created slick road conditions in parts of Nebraska Sunday night, the weather service office in North Platte said. The conditions closed a more than 100-mile portion of I-80 in the state Sunday night. The roadway remained closed Monday morning after the icy mix turned to blowing snow and created whiteout conditions.

Slick conditions also wreaked havoc in Minnesota where nearly 400 crashes and more than 300 spinouts have occurred since Sunday, according the Minnesota State Patrol.

Widespread power outages are also a concern as power lines and trees are likely to be damaged by strong winds and accumulations of heavy, wet snow, the weather service said.

Winter storm warnings stretch from New Mexico to Wisconsin and the Dakotas, where snowfall totals of 4 to 12 inches are possible.

Last week, a storm dumped snow from the northern Plains to the Northeast. The heaviest snow focused on the Northeast where parts of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, saw more than 2 feet of snow.

Nearly 130,000 homes and businesses are still without power across the region as of Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. The majority of outages are in Maine, where nearly 100,000 customers are in the dark.

Many power lines were grounded across Maine after the storm blew through, according to Central Maine Power. The utility said its crews responded to more than 700 emergency calls Sunday for issues including blocked roads and downed lines.

Though the Maine utility had restored power to more than 50% of customers impacted by the storm as of Sunday night, restoration efforts in severely impacted coastal areas could last through Wednesday, it said.

Strong tornadoes possible in Gulf Coast states

The southern side of the storm will produce damaging thunderstorms in the South Monday. Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is providing plenty of fuel for thunderstorms to unload damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes.

A few of these tornadoes could become strong – meaning EF2-strength or greater – the Storm Prediction Center warned Monday.

Thunderstorms were ongoing Monday morning from Texas to Arkansas but are forecast to intensify as the storm system tracks east.

The greatest risk for severe thunderstorms and strong tornadoes will center on parts of Louisiana and Mississippi from Monday afternoon into Monday night.

Heavy rainfall could also lead to flooding in parts of the Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast. Portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Missouri are under a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall Monday.

Thunderstorms will track into the Southeast on Tuesday, but any damaging storms are expected to be isolated in nature.

31,"Everest climbers will have to take their poop away with them, as Nepal tries to address growing waste problem","CNN —

Oxygen? Check. Crampons? Check. Poop bags?… Check.

Those hoping to climb Everest this year will have to make some slight adjustments to their packing list, as new rules now mandate that climbers bring their excrement down with them from the world’s highest peak, in a bid to tackle pollution.

Most people who attempt to climb the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) Mount Everest do so via Nepal, paying $11,000 apiece just for the climbing permit.

With gear, food, supplemental oxygen, Sherpa guides and more, it costs upward of $35,000 to take on the mountain.

But the world’s highest peak has a poop problem, driven by the number of visitors, and the harsh conditions on the mountain, which interfere with the degradation process.

“The problem of human waste on Everest was very bad,” Diwas Pokhrel, first vice president of Everest Summiteers Association, told CNN, adding that at the mountain’s highest points, it was “polluting the mountain environment.”

Without the new rules, the poo problem was highly likely to get worse: Last year, Nepal gave out a record 478 climbing permits to climb the peak. Twelve climbers were confirmed to have died on the mountain, while another five remain officially missing.

Jinesh Sindurakar of the Nepal Mountaineering Association told CNN that an estimated 1,200 people will be on Everest this season.

“Each person produces 250 grams (8.8 ounces) of excrement a day and they will spend 2 weeks on the higher camps for the summit push,” Sindurakar explained, adding that each climber will be given two poop bags, which can each be used six times.

The bags contain chemicals to solidify the human waste and make it odorless, Sindurakar said, and Nepal’s Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality will issue some 8,000 bags this season.

Efforts to reduce the impact of tourism on the Himalayas have stepped up, with 35,708 kilograms of waste and plastics removed from peaks including Everest, Lhotse, Annapurna and Baruntse through an initiative led by the Nepali Army, according to the Himalayan Times.

32,Lunar eclipse: Here’s how to see the upcoming worm moon,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

A glowing worm moon will light up the sky on Monday with a celestial performance in store for people venturing out in the early morning hours — a penumbral lunar eclipse.

March’s full moon, referred to as the worm moon by the Farmers’ Almanac due to its proximity to the spring equinox, will be at its fullest at 3 a.m. ET.

A few hours earlier, starting at 12:53 a.m. ET, according to EarthSky, the moon will be almost perfectly aligned with the sun and Earth, causing the outer edge of Earth’s shadow, known as the penumbra, to be cast onto the glowing orb.

The greatest eclipse will be at 3:12 a.m. ET, when the moon will appear to be slightly darker than usual, said Dr. Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.

“It’ll be almost a gradient of darkening happening from one side of the moon to the other. It’s not going to be a super dramatic change in what we see in the moon,” Schmoll said. “But if you’re sitting there watching it, you might notice some slight variations in brightness.”

The worm moon — named by Native American tribes in reference to the beetle larvae and other creatures that emerge from hibernation in the spring — will be visible to everyone across the world, since the moon will appear to be full for a couple of days.

However, the penumbral eclipse will only be visible to those who are on the night side of Earth when the event occurs, including Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America. The lunar eclipse will finish at 5:33 a.m. ET, according to EarthSky.

The penumbral eclipse comes about two weeks before a total solar eclipse that will cross Mexico, the United States and Canada on April 8. Lunar and solar eclipses always come in pairs due to the period when the sun, Earth and moon stay aligned, Schmoll said. While the full moon will be caught in Earth’s shadow during this penumbral eclipse, the moon’s next new moon phase will allow for the conditions needed for a solar eclipse, when the moon will be in between the sun and Earth and thus block the face of the sun from view.

Eclipse season

An “eclipse season” is the approximate 35-day period that occurs every six months, near the equinoxes, when the near-perfect alignment of the three celestial bodies needed for eclipses occurs, according to NASA.

A lunar eclipse does not happen monthly during each full moon because the moon’s orbital plane is tilted by about 5 degrees, so for most full moons, the shadow of the Earth will be just below or above the moon, Schmoll said.

While a penumbral eclipse is not as dramatic as a total lunar eclipse with the moon appearing an eerie red, there is no special equipment required to view a lunar eclipse such as the viewing glasses needed for a solar eclipse, Schmoll said, allowing for lunar eclipses to be viewed with the naked eye.

“You pretty much just need to be outside with a clear view of the moon when it’s happening,” Schmoll added. “(Eclipses are) always a good excuse to go outside and try to look at the sky and appreciate where we are in the universe, and what we are able to observe from our planet.”

Solar and lunar eclipses

While the most highly anticipated of the four eclipse events occurring in 2024 is the total solar eclipse on April 8, an annular solar eclipse will occur on October 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow.

Meanwhile, a partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.

Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.

More full moons this year

Of the 12 full moons in 2024, the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.

Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit.

Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:

• April 23: Pink moon

• May 23: Flower moon

• June 21: Strawberry moon

• July 21: Buck moon

• August 19: Sturgeon moon

• September 17: Harvest moon

• October 17: Hunter’s moon

• November 15: Beaver moon

• December 15: Cold moon

33,Sacha Baron Cohen’s representative responds to Rebel Wilson claims,"CNN —

Rebel Wilson is claiming Sacha Baron Cohen has tried to stop the release of her upcoming memoir, “Rebel Rising.”

Wilson and Baron Cohen starred together “The Brothers Grimsby” in 2016.

“I will not be bullied or silenced with high priced lawyer or PR crisis managers,” Wilson wrote on her Instagram stories on Monday. “The ‘a**hole’ that I am talking about in ONE CHAPTER of my book is Sacha Baron Cohen.”

Without naming Baron Cohen, Wilson had previously written on social media: “He’s trying to stop press coming out about my new book. But the book WILL come out and you will all know the truth.”

In her posts, Wilson did not specify what she wrote about Baron Cohen. However, a spokesperson for the comedian and actor told CNN Wilson’s claims are false.

“While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of The Brothers Grimsby,” the spokesperson said.

“When I first came to Hollywood, people were like, yeah, ‘I have a no a**hole policy, means like, yeah, I don’t work with a**holes.’ I was like, ‘Oh yeah. I mean, that sounds sensible or logical. But then it really sunk in because I worked with a massive a**hole and yeah, now I definitely have a no a**holes policy,” Wilson said in a video shared on Instagram earlier this month.

In a 2016 interview with UK Marie Claire, Wilson spoke about Baron Cohen wanting her to film a nude scene in “The Brothers Grimsby,” which she declined.

“You want to know that the people (behind the camera) have a certain sensibility and decency,” Wilson said at the time. “And a lot of times in comedy they’re not those people.”

35,Why are bidets just now getting popular in America?,"New York CNN —

Bring up installing a bidet to the average American before the pandemic, and they might have likely flushed the idea straightaway.

The bathroom washer business, once a foreign concept to many in the US, experienced a huge boom during the Covid-19 pandemic, when shoppers were battling over toilet paper shortages. But while some products or industries saw a boom during Covid that later came back down to earth –- say, masks, roller skates, pet adoptions, Zoom subscriptions, Peloton bikes -– bidets made a big splash and have managed to maintain sales growth.

Bidets and their product cousins – washlets, “bum guns” and other water-based alternatives to toilet paper – are universal in most parts of the world; bidet enthusiasts tout how the devices are more sustainable, clean, and less abrasive. But Americans just can’t seem to let go of the Charmin Bear. It took a toilet paper shortage for some to come around to the 18th-century invention.

During the pandemic, every single bidet sold out at bidetking.com, and the business grew exponentially, bidetking.com founder James Lin said.

The site faced a massive supply crunch, and it had to air freight costly containers to meet demands. Lin described shipments of products from abroad by water completely selling out before they even hit the warehouse.

By some estimates, the entire bidet market grew two to three times during 2020. Tushy, which makes a trendy bidet seat attachment, pulled in a revenue of $40 million in 2020 versus $8 million in 2019, founder Miki Agrawal said to CNN.

Americans are still intrigued by the bidet. Bidetking.com reports sales have grown a minimum of 20% each year since the pandemic, with 2023 closer to 30%.

A bidet for every bum

A dizzying array of bidet options confront the burgeoning American consumer. Big spenders can find luxury options to give their porcelain throne the royal treatment. Japanese electronic bidet seat maker Toto sells a “washlet” for as much as $1,420 on bidetking.com, equipped with a water heating system (that heats the toilet seat and the jet streams of water that clean the user’s backside), a wireless remote control (with multiple spray settings) and a hands-free dryer. Tushy, defined by its whimsical marketing, sells a popular bidet attachment starting at $99.

Few people buy a bidet every year, so much of the growth is coming from new customers. Often, bidet sales spread just through word of mouth. Once one person is converted to the new method of bathroom sanitation, they want their friends and family to join the club. And many of those customers often become entrenched rather than transient.

Some customers who start with more basic washer attachments are now upgrading to electronic models that have different temperature and pressure settings. The most popular type of bidet in the US, Lin said, is a non-electric attachment that only sprays cold water, found for less than $50 on sites like Amazon.

Others have found an even cheaper alternative. Joe from Michigan, who did not want to be identified by his last name, says he grabbed a bidet attached to a toilet being discarded on the side of the street, and purchased an adapter hose to fit it into his home (after sanitizing it).

“Gosh, I wish I would have known about it sooner,” Joe told CNN.

A foreign concept from the start

The idea to use flowing water – rather than harder objects, whether leaves or paper – to clean one’s underside may be as old as human existence.

The bidet originated in France, used by aristocrats as a separate piece of furniture next to the chamber pot. Variations of the bidet are ubiquitous in a large swath of Europe to the Middle East, East Asia and some South American countries.

During the booming electronics era, the Japanese brand Toto revolutionized the washlet in 1980 with a toilet seat attachment that uses warm water to cleanse. The devices have proliferated to homes and businesses around Japan and beyond.

A common reason why bidets aren’t used in the US is that during World War 2, American soldiers saw brothels utilizing bidets. When they came back to United States, they shunned the bidet because of the connotations. Plus, the construction boom that took place in the post-war years built plumbing systems without bidets. (Japanese washlets and other devices, however, connect to existing toilets and don’t require separate plumbing like French-style bidets.)

The foreignness of bidets stuck. Some of the new bidet users CNN interviewed said they had associated the object with places like Europe or Japan, or something found in fancy hotels. When Joe and his wife lived in Spain, he initially didn’t even know what the unattached bidet in their apartment bathroom was used for.

Agrawal, the Tushy founder, said she was drawn to the bidet business because it was a standard practice she grew up in with an Indian father and Japanese mother.

Of course, for many, water-based cleanliness has long been entrenched in their culture, going back centuries.

For example, for practicing Muslims, the Islamic jurisprudence lays out strict guidelines on washing oneself. Many Asian and Middle Eastern countries utilize “bum guns,” or low-cost handheld sprayers attached by a hose to the side of the toilet, or jugs that look like watering cans.

Eyad Atieh, a resident physician in Illinois, spent part of his childhood and adolesence in Jordan, where every house had a bidet installed. In his medical training, he learned the bidet’s health benefits, especially for those who suffer from hemorrhoids and hernias.

“A big part of our culture is using water to clean, otherwise you can’t pray, you can’t be considered clean Islamically,” Atieh said.

Big Toilet Paper

When the great toilet paper shortage hit in 2020, many Americans realized there could be another way to clean themselves. Environmental concerns around trees, paper and waste perhaps also played a role.

Using toilet paper had seemed, somehow, American, with toilet paper jokes a staple in bathroom humor and “TP-ing” a stereotypical rite of passage for teens. And little is more American than the Charmin bear, an industry emblem that already dominates aisles of supermarkets.

So, “getting consumers to do something different, they have to undo all those brand associations (with toilet paper) and all those habits they have,” Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Kellogg School of Management told CNN.

Rucker said the bidet industry would need to become a social norm in the US, such as being built into more new home constructions. Many bidet users in the US were converted after visiting societies where bidet use is widespread.

Mikaela Koelzer, in Chicago, visited Japan the summer before the pandemic and was awestruck by the variety of bidet settings in even the most hole-in-the-wall restaurants.

Then the pandemic hit, and Koelzer had “nothing but time” to find “pockets of joy” in her day. With the toilet paper mania, she decided to kill two birds with one stone and splurge on a Tushy.

“It moreso was just about nurturing myself and feeling like I was doing something good for myself in a way that I could control, because everything else was just so out of control,” Koelzer said.

Though Koelzer has a basic Tushy, her parents are now looking into a more state-of-the-art one that has temperature controls, she says. Two of her friends are now “proud bidet owners.”",https://edition.cnn.com
36,Foam rollers: The must-have tool for soothing sore muscles,"Editor’s note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”

CNN —

Have your legs ever been so stiff and tired that simply bending down to tie your shoes felt like a Herculean task? Whether muscular discomfort comes from an intense workout or too much sitting, wanting to soothe sore muscles is a shared human experience. But because it’s an unrealistic luxury for most of us to receive daily massages or splurge on the latest high-tech massage gun, we need a more practical option.

Enter the foam roller: an affordable and accessible self-care solution that’s backed by science for its muscle-soothing benefits. With consistent use, this simple tool can be a game changer in how you feel and move.

What is a foam roller?

A foam roller, as its name implies, is a cylindrical piece of dense foam. Rollers come in a variety of sizes ranging from 1-4 feet (0.3-1.2 meters) in length and 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) in diameter.

The handy cylinders also vary in degrees of firmness, surface textures and features designed to meet desired intensity levels and uses.

The ubiquitous gym staple is available from most major department stores starting at prices as low as $5. Larger sizes and more features (like bumps or points) drive up the price but generally aren’t necessary to reap the science-backed benefits.

What does foam rolling do?

Considered a self-myofascial release tool, a foam roller can relieve soreness and inflammation, increase range of motion, alleviate muscular tension and release tight fascia — the thin layer of connective tissue under the skin surrounding muscles.

Research is increasingly shedding more light on the effectiveness of foam rolling to improve how you feel and move. A comprehensive analysis of 49 studies found that engaging in foam-rolling sessions of 90 seconds to two minutes had the capacity to reduce muscle stiffness and increase range of motion. One longer-term study revealed that foam rolling focused on the backs of the legs three times per week for four weeks improved hamstring flexibility.

And a smaller-scale study found foam rolling during exercise warm-up sessions to be more effective than both static and dynamic stretching for improving flexibility without hampering strength. While more research is warranted, current science on foam rolling shows promising benefits.

Muscle soreness: Considerations and safety tips

While foam rolling offers numerous benefits, it’s important to proceed with caution. Individuals who are pregnant or with conditions such as muscle tears, arthritis, osteoporosis, varicose veins, or any other existing injuries or conditions should seek guidance from their health care provider.

Always practice body awareness when foam rolling to differentiate between general muscle soreness you feel after a workout or prolonged sitting versus cautionary discomfort due to a strain or injury that could be unsafe to roll. If you’re unsure about the source of your muscle soreness or whether foam rolling is safe for you, talk to your physical therapist or doctor.

When selecting a foam roller, keep in mind your pressure tolerance. A harder or bumpier roller will increase sensation. Regardless of the type of roller, always avoid rolling directly over joints, bony areas (such as the neck or spine) or thin skin.

When, where and how to roll:

Incorporating foam rolling into your fitness routine or lifestyle can be simple with some practical guidance.

Include foam rolling as part of your warm-ups prior to any fitness activities to increase blood flow to your muscles and enhance flexibility. As a strength and mobility coach in professional sports, I recommend that all of my athletes prep for their workouts by foam rolling.

If you have a tendency for chronic tension or experience soreness after intense activity or prolonged sitting, use your foam roller to address the areas of discomfort. Personally, I keep a foam roller in my office and use it on my back, glutes and hamstrings after any long bouts of sitting at my desk.

Below I’ve outlined areas you can safely target with your foam roller. Place the roller on the ground and use your body weight to apply rolling pressure (like flattening a piece of dough with a rolling pin). Choose areas that make the most sense for you based on what you’re feeling and any activities you plan to do right after rolling. Roll each of your targeted areas for at least 90 seconds, starting with gentle pressure and gradually increasing intensity as you feel comfortable. Consistency is key — aim for three or more foam-rolling sessions per week to realize lasting benefits.

Calves

With both hands on the floor behind you for support, rest your calves (back of lower legs) on the roller. Cross your legs at the ankle. Roll from just above your ankle to just below your knee. Repeat on the other side.

Hamstrings

Rest your hamstrings (back of upper legs) on the roller with both hands on the floor behind you for support. Bend one knee to place a foot on the roller. Roll your hamstrings from the fold of your glute (bottom) to just above the back of your knees. Repeat on the other side.

Glutes

Sitting on the roller, bend your leg to bring your foot to the opposite knee. Place a hand on the floor for support. Lean your weight into the bent-knee side and slowly roll the entire glute area (back and outside of your hip). Repeat on the other side.

IT band/outside of leg

From a side forearm plank, rest your lower leg on top of the roller and place your top foot on the floor for support. Roll from the outside of your hip to just above your knee. If the sensation is too intense, shift more weight into your supporting foot. To increase intensity, stack your legs.

Adductors/inside of leg

From a forearm plank position with your core engaged for support, slightly spread your legs and open one hip to align the roller on a slight diagonal along your adductors (inner thigh). Roll along the entire length of your adductors from the groins to just before the knee.

Quadriceps

Take a forearm plank position with your quadriceps (thighs) resting evenly on the roller. Engage core muscles and walk your forearms forward and back for support as you roll from just below your hips to just above your knees.

Back

Again, avoid rolling your cervical spine or neck area, and if you have any history of spinal injury or genetic spinal conditions, consult your doctor.

Upper/midback: Lie on the roller with it positioned across your upper back. Keep both knees bent with your feet down and core engaged for support. Maintain a neutral neck position with your hands placed gently behind your head. Roll slowly from your upper back to the base of your ribcage. To increase intensity, cross your arms in front.

Lower back: From the same position, roll from just above your hips to just below your ribs.

Foam rolling is a simple yet powerful tool for soothing sore muscles, improving range of motion and enhancing recovery. By understanding its benefits, following practical guidance, and prioritizing safety, you can harness its full potential to help you feel and move better.

37,Could real estate go the way of the travel industry? Not just yet,"CNN —

Technology has revolutionized how people book travel, buy groceries and manage their everyday finances. Yet, the process of buying a home has withstood many similar changes.

Sites like Redfin and Zillow provide a way for buyers and brokers to connect online, but the role of real estate agents in closing purchases has persisted.

Now the seismic settlement between the National Association of Realtors and home sellers could change that, as home buyers and sellers face the prospect of paying their agents separately, instead of sellers paying a commission split between both sides. That, in turn, opens the door for new technology to reshape the agents’ role, as people in other jobs — from the world of finance to travel — have already experienced.

Given the settlement, Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said buyers’ agents might see their work simplified through technology consumers can use themselves, similar to changes in money management.

“I think we are reaching a point where there’s going to be a lot of innovation in the housing market,” Piskorski said. “One simple idea is: Do homeowners really need a real estate agent?”

Nearly half of home buyers began their search online, according to a 2023 report by the NAR, and many buyers do home research themselves.

“Ultimately, people will understand what real estate agents really do, especially on the buy side,” Piskorski said. “The whole business model actually under which we operate right now makes these fees not very transparent to home buyers.”

Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told CNN in an email that technology could make things easier for buyers in an industry that has often been opaque.

“Ultimately, if these changes bring about greater consumer transparency, that’s a good thing,” Hale told CNN.

But even with the possibility of major changes, Hale said, one thing will almost certainly remain the same for real estate agents. Buyers, she noted, “will likely be reluctant to navigate the financial decision of a lifetime without their professional expertise and support.”

Finance, travel and other models

The NAR settlement essentially decouples the buyers’ and sellers’ agents. While previously home sellers have paid a commission (generally 5% to 6%) that was split between agents, the settlement makes it so home buyers might be on the hook for paying their agent up front.

Experts told CNN that could affect how home buyers think about enlisting an agent.

Currently, the framework of real estate solely emphasizes the buy and sell transaction, said John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada, a real estate tech company. Yet, as technology simplifies the process, agents will have to advertise their value as long-term consultants in a niche industry.

Bodrozic said tech will enable real estate to become more like personal finance in this sense.

“I really believe it’s a bigger picture here, which is the opportunity for the real estate industry to think of their clients as a never-ending client that I want to keep happy and provide value to throughout their entire journey,” he said.

Bobby Juncosa, chief technology officer of Edgewise, a real estate tech company, said there are lessons from how travel agents changed as technology has allowed people to search for, compare and purchase flights on their own.

“The buyers’ agent will become, this is the part that’s a little bit more controversial, but a little bit more travel agent-esque, and they’re kind of pointing you in the right direction,” he said. “You know, ‘this neighborhood has good schools,’ all things that are public information that you could find out on your own, but you’re hoping for that local expertise.”

A lot of real estate transactions could be digitized, and this settlement may provide impetus for that, Piskorski said. He said developments in tech that organize home inspections, make arrangements to hire lawyers or fulfill other duties of a buyers’ agent, would “significantly reduce the costs associated with home transactions.”

Even as technology expands further into the real estate industry, Piskorski said he thinks a fully automated process, such as an Amazon marketplace for buying and selling homes, is still far in the distance.

The real estate market, he said, is “too complex to be completely automated on a computer.”

Juncosa said as the industry adjusts to the settlement rules, agents will become more like consultants throughout the home buying process, offering value-add insight. Yet what ultimately differentiates a travel agent from a real estate agent is the value and risk associated with the purchase.

Purchasing a home is a major life decision, and some people will always benefit from the assurance of a broker, Juncosa said.

A key point of home buying is the behavioral aspect, Piskorski said. “Some households just want a human being to be with them, to assure them that this is the right decision,” he said.

Ultimately, Juncosa said that agents serve a fundamentally human purpose: reassuring homebuyers about the biggest financial decisions of their lives.",https://edition.cnn.com
38,Trump is about to get $3 billion richer after deal is approved to take his company public. But it won’t solve his cash crunch,"CNN —

Investors have approved a deal on Friday to make Truth Social owner Trump Media a publicly traded company.

The green light from shareholders clears a major hurdle for a long-delayed merger that will generate a multi-billion dollar windfall for former President Donald Trump at a time when he’s facing immense financial and legal pressure.

According to a preliminary vote total announced during the meeting, a majority of shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp. voted in favor of the deal to merge with Trump Media. The companies have indicated the merger could close as soon as early next week.

The new company will be called Trump Media & Technology Group and trade under the ticker DJT, Trump’s initials. It will own Trump’s struggling social media platform Truth Social.

Shareholders voted to approve Trump Media’s merger with a blank-check company, following years of legal and regulatory obstacles. Trump will own a dominant stake in a public company, with shares worth more than $3 billion at current market prices.

However, experts tell CNN there are numerous practical, financial and legal reasons why this deal is unlikely to solve Trump’s imminent cash crunch.

“President Trump won’t be able to monetize that stake right away,” said Matthew Kennedy, senior initial public offering market strategist at Renaissance Capital.

Trump faces a Monday deadline to post a $464 million bond in New York’s civil fraud case against him or New York’s attorney general could try to seize his golf course and private estate north of Manhattan – or other assets.

The good news for Trump is that there are strong incentives for shareholders to approve the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp.

If it gets the green light from shareholders, Trump stands to be the dominant shareholder, with a stake of at least 58.1%, according to filings.

The merger agreement calls for Trump to own roughly 79 million shares of the new public company – and potentially tens of millions more if certain goals are hit.

At Digital World’s share price of around $43 Thursday, that massive stake would be worth $3.4 billion – at least on paper. But Digital World shares were volatile Friday, and they were closed 14% lower.

The merger could close swiftly.

Regulatory filings indicate the companies expect to close the merger on the second business day after the shareholder vote is approved. That sets the stage for trading to begin under the new name and ticker symbol by Tuesday or Wednesday, although it could take longer, according to Kennedy.

But the deal still faces legal uncertainty. There is ongoing litigation seeking to block the merger from closing.

‘Clearly a bubble’

The bad news for Trump is that this stake is not as liquid as it sounds. Those paper gains would be very difficult for Trump to translate to actual cash.

In fact, Trump’s shares in this company are in many ways even less liquid than his real estate holdings, according to Charles Whitehead, a law professor at Cornell Law School.

First, experts say the market is drastically overvaluing Trump Media based on the company’s fundamentals.

That means Trump would have a hard time dumping the stock or even pledging it as collateral.

“The stock price is clearly a bubble,” Yale law professor Jonathan Macey told CNN. “No rational investor would take the stock at face value, especially if they had to hold it for any length of time.”

SEC filings indicate Trump Media’s revenue amounted to just $1.1 million during the third quarter. The company posted a loss of $26 million that quarter.

Truth Social’s shrinking user base

Not only that, but Truth Social appears to be shrinking.

The number of Truth Social’s US monthly active users on iOS and Android is down 39% year-over-year, according to Similarweb data shared with CNN earlier this month. Truth Social remains much smaller than X (formerly Twitter), which is also shrinking but at a slower pace.

And yet Trump Media is being valued north of $6 billion on a fully diluted basis, which includes all stocks and options that could be converted to common stock, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.

Ritter said the current market price is hard, if not impossible, to justify.

“It is grossly overvalued,” said Ritter. “It qualifies as a meme stock for which the price is divorced from fundamental value…Meme stock investors are usually buying on the basis of the greater fool theory of investing: It is overvalued today, but I hope to make money selling it to an even greater fool tomorrow at an even higher price.”

Insiders can’t sell right away

But even in the unlikely event that Trump found a taker for those shares, experts say he is likely not allowed to sell or pledge that stock – at least not yet.

As is typical in a deal like this, certain shareholders are subject to a lock-up period that prevents insiders from immediately selling.

“No one wants to buy into a company where the largest shareholder – and really the face of the biggest product – is selling,” said Whitehead.

In this case, key shareholders of Trump Media, including its management team, have agreed not to sell their common stock for six months to maintain “important stability to the leadership and governance” of the company, according to SEC filings.

Not only does that lock-up agreement prevent these key shareholders from selling their stock for six months, it says they have agreed not to “lend, offer, pledge…encumber, donate” that stock during the period.

If the share price stays above $12 for a period of time, it’s possible that insiders can sell or pledge their stock 150 days after the deal closes.

“The lock-up is meant to stop insiders from selling immediately after the merger,” said Xavier Kowalski, a former partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel who is now a lecturer in the finance department at the University of Florida. “It also stops them from pledging the stock, like with a margin loan. So it’s going to be difficult to find a way to use those shares to get cash for now.”

Banks may balk

Moreover, there are additional lock-up restrictions contained in an amended charter that experts say appear to include Trump. That lock-up also restricts certain shareholders from immediately selling after the deal closes.

“If his shares are covered by the charter’s lockup provisions then, absent an amendment to the charter, President Trump cannot pledge this stock. Full stop,” Whitehead said.

And amending the charter would be tricky – even for Trump and his outsized sway over the company. That’s the kind of thing that would have to be disclosed ahead of time because it would impact potential buyers of the stock.

“He can’t do this quietly. If President Trump today intends to amend the charter and they are not disclosing this intention, that’s a problem,” Whitehead said. “Presumably, they would need to take the position after the vote approving the merger that President Trump woke up and suddenly said, ‘Hey, let’s amend the charter.’”

Now even if Trump overcame these potentially insurmountable obstacles, there is no guarantee any bank would take this stock as collateral in a loan.

“If I’m a bank, I’m going to be troubled by the idea of a significant shareholder pledging his stake,” Whitehead said. “Any bank doing a proper credit analysis must be sensitive to the fact that this stock may very well tank if it turns out that President Trump is looking to sell down the position.”

39,Navy Federal says external review finds ‘non-race factors’ explained mortgage approval disparities,"CNN —

The nation’s largest credit union said this week that an external review found it hadn’t considered race in mortgage underwriting, responding to CNN’s previous reporting about racial gaps in its mortgage approval rates.

Navy Federal Credit Union, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, Department of Defense personnel, veterans and their families, said a review it commissioned from a civil rights lawyer “found no race-based decision making in our mortgage underwriting” and that “legitimate, non-race factors” had largely explained racial differences in approval rates.

A CNN investigation published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for more than a dozen different variables available in public mortgage data, including applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found.

In addition, an analysis by staff of the Senate Banking Committee, which 10 Democratic senators cited in a letter asking federal regulators to review Navy Federal’s mortgage lending earlier this year, also found racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage approval rates based on the publicly available data.

Navy Federal said Thursday that an analysis it had commissioned by lawyer Debo Adegbile, a former member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, found that those racial disparities were largely accounted for by examining “all non-public underwriting factors.”

“Our review found that when all relevant factors are controlled for, which CNN did not do, the difference in approval rates between Black and White borrowers falls to less than 1%,” Adegbile said in a statement. “The remaining difference in approval rates is explained by legitimate, non-race factors like income verification and incomplete credit applications.” The analysis also accounted for other non-public factors including applicants’ credit scores, the statement said.

A spokesperson for Navy Federal did not respond to a request for additional details about the analysis.

As CNN previously reported, applicants’ credit scores are not available in the public mortgage data, and Navy Federal declined to provide CNN any data that would make it possible to analyze credit scores or other non-public factors.

CNN’s analysis only included mortgage applications that were listed in the public data as being fully submitted and either approved or denied, and excluded those that were listed as “closed for incompleteness.” And while Navy Federal’s statement said its analysis included applicants’ debt-to-income ratios, CNN’s review also took those ratios, which are available in the public mortgage data, into account.

Navy Federal described Adegbile’s analysis as an “external review,” but his law firm, WilmerHale, is also defending Navy Federal in a class-action lawsuit from Black and Latino borrowers who allege the credit union discriminated against them in mortgage applications.

The same day that Navy Federal released a statement about the review, other lawyers from WilmerHale filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which had cited CNN’s reporting. Attorneys for the credit union argued that the “alleged statistical disparities” the plaintiffs had cited were not sufficient to prove discrimination, and that they “fail to identify any Navy Federal policy or practice that caused any disparity.”

The lawyers also argued that agreements the plaintiffs had signed when they became members of the credit union had required them to give Navy Federal adequate notice before filing a lawsuit, and that most had not done so.

Adegbile’s analysis was not included in Navy Federal’s motion to dismiss the case.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys – Ben Crump, Adam Levitt, and Hassan Zavareei – said in a statement that it was “a classic conflict of interest” for Adegbile to review Navy Federal’s practices at the same time his firm was defending the credit union in court.

“Navy Federal should immediately put out the full investigative report and data analysis so that Navy Federal’s members have an opportunity for themselves to review the findings,” the statement said.

In its statement, Navy Federal also said it was “currently examining initiatives to build on our mission of expanding access to credit for our diverse community of members and continue our efforts to address systemic barriers to homeownership.”",https://edition.cnn.com
40,Great Lakes small businesses and ski areas pivot following a record warm winter,"Chicago CNN —

This winter, every morning that hotel owner Kelli Doyen looked outside her window, she hoped to see the Gwinn Model Towne Inn’s snowmobile caked in snow.

“We are one of only four properties that has a snowmobile trail right off the property,” said Doyen, who co-owns the hotel on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula with her husband. In past seasons, that competitive advantage lured roughly 800 snowmobilers – it’s a top winter sport in northern states – to the hotel in Gwinn, Michigan, roughly 20 miles from Marquette.

This year, instead of fresh powder, too often Doyen said she saw a muddy path.

Now, as the season draws to a close, “We are down 70% over sales from last winter,” she said. “We have had a pretty tough go of it.”

The 2023-2024 season marked the warmest winter on record for the lower 48 states, according to NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information. The change in the weather has had an outsize impact on the festivals, events and tourism that define the Great Lakes identity and produce the income of those living and working there. All told, eight states experienced a record-warm season, including Wisconsin, Michigan, New York and Minnesota, plus North Dakota, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire.

Instead of a winter wonderland, the past several months have offered tourists less snow, less ice aind less opportunity for some outdoor activities. Small businesses owners and regional industries scrambled to adapt. Less outdoor ice skating might mean more indoor ice-skating. Less snow-shoeing meant more pickleball in some places.

Doyen said the loss of income amounts to roughly $70,000. She’s one of several business owners in the midwest whose winter sales keep them afloat until the summer tourism season begins. Since purchasing the property in 2020 - just before Covid hit – Doyen said she has invested a bulk of her profit into renovations. Operating expenses total $15,000 per month. With the drop in bookings, her husband has pulled from his 401(k) to stay open.

“The last six months, I’ve spent every night here because I can’t afford to pay somebody to be here,” Doyen said. “We’re down to our last $20,000 and we have to make it to June.”

“It’s depressing. It’s exhausting.”

Event and revenue meltdowns

With less snowfall, severe drought expanded over portions of Wisconsin and Michigan and increased in Iowa during the winter months, according to the US Drought Monitor. The situation grew so dire that governors in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin announced businesses impacted by drought may be eligible for loans from the Small Business Administration.

“From skiing and snowshoeing to winter festivals, snowy winters are part of our way of life in Minnesota,” Gov. Tim Waltz said in a news release in March 7. “The low precipitation we’ve experienced this winter has had a real economic impact on small businesses that rely on snow and winter tourism to grow and survive.”

Susan Estler, CEO of Travel Marquette in Marquette, Michigan, told CNN hotel bookings between Christmas and March are down 16% this year.

“We are dependent on the snow for outdoor activities,” Estler said. “Reservations are down. Businesses are down.”

Estler estimates roughly 30% of tourism dollars are spent on hotels. That means the other 70% supports the local economy -– from gas stations to grocery stores to restaurants.

“All of those things have been impacted,” she said.

Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis highlights the significance of climate, and of snow in particular, on business owners’ bottom line. According to the BEA, snow activities in states clustered around the Great Lakes add hundreds of millions of dollars to the region’s economy. For example, Wisconsin snow activities added $83.6 million in 2022, according to the BEA, and roughly $130 million in Michigan the same year.

Adapting business plans

Some events that normally bring throngs of tourists to Marquette were forced to cancel this year. That includes the UP200, a sled-dog race and qualifier for the famous Iditarod race in Alaska.

“Safety is our top priority and given the lack of snow and the warm temperatures, we cannot offer a safe race,” said Darlene Welch, UP200 President, in a statement on the UP200 website in February.

Estler noted the UP200 still held an outdoor festival instead of a race, an example of businesses quickly adapting to what may become a new normal.

“The time for adjustment is really now,” she said. “Hopefully we will be getting an early spring and an early summer so [businesses] can start recouping some of the money that they lost during the winter.”

A road in Michigan during a snowy phase of winter in February 7, 2023 Christopher Germain

Christopher Germain, CEO of Lake Superior Community Partnership, said some ski areas have been offering summertime kayaking packages and outdoor space for special events and weddings to offset the loss in wintertime revenue. Germain added “Some of our small businesses are pairing up with each other to do special dining events.”

Partnerships and discounts

Germain, Estler, and Doyen are all transplants who moved to northern Michigan enchanted by the majesty of Upper Peninsula winters.

“I actually interviewed during the winter, toward the end of January, and it was just breathtakingly beautiful,” Estler said. “The identity of the UP and especially Marquette is very much tied to the winter season and always has been. So, it is quite unusual to have this.”

Doyen said one of the most difficult parts of her hotel’s emptiness is her inability to deliver more visitors, activities and, therefore, ancillary revenue for her neighbors.

“The fact that we have been empty has hurt our community too,” Doyen said

Despite the challenges, Doyen still loves running the Inn, and plans to keep her doors open as long as possible.

“We actually care about our guests and care about our community.”

Doyen told CNN she also plans to offer a 20 percent discount through the spring months in hopes of bringing in more visitors.

Going forward, “You can’t plan around one season anymore,” Germain said.",https://edition.cnn.com

With no winner of the Mega Millions jackpot Friday, the grand prize for Tuesday’s drawing grew past the billion-dollar mark, according to the lottery.

The jackpot for the next drawing on Tuesday night – an estimated $1.1 billion – marks the first time in seven months that the jackpot prize has topped $1 billion and only the sixth time in less than six years that the Mega Millions jackpot hit that threshold, according to the lottery.

Friday’s winning numbers were: 3, 8, 31, 35, 44 and Mega Ball 16.

While there was no big winner Friday, five tickets matched five of the numbers to win the game’s $1 million prize, Mega Millions said. Another player in Virginia won $3 million by activating the Megaplier, according to the lottery.

If the jackpot is won next Tuesday, it would be the fifth largest prize in the history of the game, according to the lottery.

In August 2023, $1.602 billion was won by a ticket that was purchased in Neptune Beach, Florida, according to the Mega Millions Jackpot history. It was the largest the jackpot prize ever won.

There has not been a Mega Millions jackpot winner since December 2023, when a prize of $394 million was snagged by two players in California. Mega Millions’ five largest jackpots all exceeded $1 billion, the lottery said.

42,The genius Roman creations that still amaze us today,"CNN —

Rome might not have built ancient history’s biggest empire – a shout out to Genghis for that one – but it was undoubtedly the most enduring and influential.

That’s because Roman passions for outrageous, oversized architecture went hand in hand with detailed record-keeping and relentless imperial PR. As a result not only have a huge number of landmark sites survived to this day, but we also know a lot about them.

So grab your toga and follow us from the sands of Africa to the soggiest bits of the Scottish Borders to discover everything from spectacular triple-decker bridges and legendary stadiums to air-fried ancient pets and a huge German gate that didn’t actually work.

Coliseum

What: The most iconic sports stadium of all

Where: Rome, Italy

Whoa: 80,000 seat Roman Super Bowl

When it comes to superlative Roman buildings, Rome’s own amphitheater is by far the most famous. With a maximum seating capacity of 80,000, it’s the largest ancient amphitheater ever built.

The instantly recognizable four-story arched oval towers nearly 50 meters (160 feet) high, and was used for gladiatorial games that went on for days at a time. The passages and rooms for waiting animals – up to 9,000 a show – and fighters can still be clearly seen under where the arena floor would have been.

We should warn you that the lines to get in now are likely even longer than the Roman ones though. So either get there very early or just enjoy watching influencers fighting their own gladiator battles over the best selfie spots as the sun goes down.

Fun fact: The floor of the Coliseum could be flooded with water for the enactment of “sea battles.”

What: Volcanically immortalized Roman towns

Where: Naples, Italy

Whoa: The closest you’ll get to 2,000 years of time travel

Pliny the Younger’s story of the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum is the original disaster movie script. It tells how the eruption of nearby Mount Vesuvius in 79 ACE buried the two towns in up to six meters of superheated ash in just two days.

That incinerated 1,000-plus inhabitants who hadn’t fled fast enough and even some of their pets. It also literally baked buildings, paintings, artifacts and even food remains into a state of perfect preservation.

While it was forgotten for over 1,000 years, this UNESCO World Heritage site now gets over 2,500,000 visitors a year.

That’s still a positive though. With the streets crowded with foreign voices and Roman shop signs and graffiti still vivid on the walls, you’ll instantly be transported back in time like no other site we know.

Funereal fact: Archaeologists have created haunting casts of Pompeii’s victims and their pets by filling the voids left in the solidified ash with plaster.

Pont du Gard

What: Incredible triple-decker bridge

Where: Gardon River, France

Whoa: 360 meters long (1,181 feet), 50 meters high, over 2,000 years old

Not only is the Pont du Gard aqueduct breathtakingly beautiful, it’s also an incredible example of how meticulous Roman engineering and mathematics were.

While most of the Western world was still relying on wells for their water until a century ago, the Romans had running water for drinking, bathing and fountains 2,000 years ago.

The triple-decker aqueduct 50 meters above the river Gardon shows just how ingenious they could be in guaranteeing that supply too.

Not only is the arched architecture absolutely beautiful, but it’s created from such precisely cut stone it doesn’t even use mortar to hold it together. Look closely and you can even see inscribed instructions as to where each stone (some as heavy as six tons) was meant to go in the grand design.

Fun fact: The overall water course length the aqueduct is part of is 50 kilometers long (30 miles) with an average gradient of just 1 in 3,000.

Lepcis Magna

What: Spectacularly preserved Roman port

Where: Libyan coast

Whoa: Seeing is still not believing

The undoubted winner of the “most incredible Roman site you’ve never heard of” award is Lepcis Magna.

It might sound more like the scientific name of a rare animal, but this Libyan site is home to an unbelievably well-preserved Roman port. Once a thriving city, flourishing on the trade from deeper Africa, Lepcis Magna was gradually swallowed up by desert sands after the Roman Empire collapsed.

It was barely disturbed for the next 1,500 years either, so the huge, column-lined forum, vast semi-circular theater overlooking the sea, multi-tier amphitheater and many stunning sculptures and murals have all survived almost intact.

Sadly, with many governments currently warning against travel to Libya, it’s one that most of us are better off viewing remotely for the time being.

Fun Fact: Lepcis Magna was the birthplace of emperor Septimus Severus and his majestic triumphal arch is the perfectly preserved gateway to the deserted city.

Pantheon

What: Unique domed temple

Where: Rome, Italy

Whoa: Unbeaten Roman engineering

If it wasn’t for the queues looping right round the square in front of it, you might think the Pantheon was “just another big Roman temple.” After all, the portico (front face) with its eight Corinthian columns and carved triangular top certainly look conventional enough.

Join the queue to get inside though, and the radical construction of this building becomes very clear.

The circular body of this temple-turned-church is topped with a stunning domed rotunda, complete with a central hole to let sunlight in.

The ceiling is awe-inspiring enough aesthetically to have you staring up in wonder, but there’s another reason to be blown away too. At 43 meters (140 feet) in diameter, this historic half-sphere is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world, nearly 2,000 years after it was made.

Fun fact: The base of the dome uses heavyweight travertine concrete while the top is lightweight tufa and pumice.

Palatine Hill

What: The heart of ancient Rome

Where: Rome, Italy

Whoa: A pancake stack of palaces

Rome might have been known as “the city of the seven hills,” but only one mound really mattered: The Palatine.

This prehistoric origin site became the must-have address of leading Republican politicians before Emperor Augustus took charge, back in 27 BCE, and started a streak of Imperial palace-building.

Tiberius, Domitian and Nero continued the pancake-stacking frenzy until the whole hill was completely buried under the masonry, monumental arches, pillars and towering retaining walls you see today.

The result is a fascinating puzzle for visitors to unravel while enjoying spectacular views of forum ruins at its feet and across to the Coliseum and Circus Maximus.

Don’t miss the house of Augustus guided tour either, as the projected displays are a masterpiece of museum tech.

Fun fact: Nero’s palace on the Palatine burnt down, so he swapped to another hill for his second “Golden Home.”

Porta Nigra

What: Huge German frontier gate

Where: Trier, Germany

Whoa: Like “Game of Thrones” but for real

Throughout Roman history, Germany was the final frontier where only the boldest of emperors would go. The remains of countless centuries of campaigning against tenacious Teutonic tribes are still relatively rare though.

This makes the Porta Nigra (Black Gate) in Trier particularly important.

While having four gates on each side of a square town was the standard Roman civic design all over the empire, Trier’s double-tower castle design is also outstanding in its size and complexity.

That’s made this dramatic structure a designated UNESCO World Heritage site and well worth a visit on any Roman road trip across Europe.

Fun fact: The archway stonework was never fully finished, which means the gates would never have shut properly.

Vindolanda

Vindolanda is still being excavated by archaeologists. makasana/iStock Editorial/Getty Images

What: Highlight of Hadrian’s Wall

Where: Northern England

Whoa: Roman love letters and so many sandals

The roller coaster, 70-mile-long turf and stone wall that Hadrian built coast to coast across northern England is a multi-site, must-visit Roman treasure in itself. Vindolanda, just to the south of the craggy, weatherbeaten ridgeline fortifications, is home to a unique and unmissable museum too.

The “Vindolanda tablets” are a collection of wooden “Post It” notes preserved in the waterlogged ground of the site. Their handwritten texts include military admin documents, curses, love letters and even a party invitation from an officer’s wife.

Together they offer a unique insight into everyday life at the farthest-flung edge of the Roman Empire.

The onsite museum also has a huge collection of superbly preserved sandals, leatherwork, fabric and even wigs from nearly 2,000 years ago.

You can watch archaeologists working on the site every summer too, so who knows what they’ll find while you’re there.

Fun fact: Hadrian’s Wall isn’t the furthest north the Romans got. Antonine built another wall further up in Scotland but didn’t like the cooking so didn’t bother staying.

Aphrodisia

What: The ancient city of love

﻿Where: Anatolia, Turkey

﻿Whoa: Incredibly intact Roman city

Despite being named after the Greek goddess of love, it’s the Roman remains that you’re going to fall head over heels for at Aphrodisia.

A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2017, Aphrodisia was largely deserted after an earthquake, so it’s been untouched for over 1,500 years.

The incredibly well-preserved remains include the towering columns of the Temple of Aphrodisia itself and a semi-circular, marble-seated Odeon for political meetings.

A vast multi-story, pillared sebastion (imperial temple), theater auditorium and bath house also wait to be discovered among scattered sculptures and whispering trees.

Or maybe you’ll want to run a Roman lap around one of the best preserved – and largest – stadiums in the empire.

Fun fact: The Temple of Aphrodisia is actually the least well-loved bit of the site as Christian Emperors partially demolished it to deter die-hard Aphrodisiacs.

Baths of Caracalla

What: Ruins of a huge public bath complex

Where: Rome, Italy

Whoa: Rome’s forgotten jaw dropper

If there was one Roman site that needs the kind of ominous drone soundtrack normally reserved for the first appearance of a planet-destroying spaceship on a cinema screen, it’s the Baths of Caracalla.

This one good deed of the infamous, brother-murdering tyrant Caracalla is often forgotten, but we reckon this behemoth of a building is absolutely worth including on any Roman itinerary.

Built from an estimated 5,000,000 tons of stone, it is genuinely jaw dropping in scale.

The furnace-stoked underfloor heating and multiple baths fed by dedicated aqueducts entertained and steam-cleaned up to 8,000 Romans a day for three centuries.

And while ruined and isolated from the normal tourist trail now, that somehow makes this monstrous local leisure center even more resonant as a vast brooding reminder of the scale Rome operated on.

Fun fact: The baths of Caracalla aren’t even the biggest in Rome. Diocletian gets that badge.

43,WindRunner: Gigantic new aircraft design aims to create the largest plane ever to fly,"CNN —

There’s a global energy crisis and onshore wind farms are a potential growth option. Larger wind turbines produce more power than standard ones, but the components are too big to be transported by road.

What’s the solution? A Colorado-based energy startup named Radia has an idea. It’s developing the biggest aircraft in aviation history.

Meet the WindRunner airplane, whose mission will be to deliver gigantic 300-foot-long blades directly to wind farms.

To help the world meet its decarbonization targets, it’ll use sustainable aviation fuel and needs only a simple packed-dirt or gravel runway to land on.

It’ll operate from regional hubs, says Radia, delivering where needed – and “can land on airstrips as short as 6,000 feet (1,800 meters), something no other large commercial aircraft can achieve.”

Where do the pilots go? Right up top. Radia

Let’s talk about specs, baby

When it comes to carrying the largest payloads ever moved by air, dainty just isn’t going to cut it.

So WindRunner will have a cargo bay volume of 272,000 cubic feet, enough to hold three Olympic swimming pools. That’s 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747-400 and – at 356 feet in length, it’s 127 feet longer too.

As for the wingspan, that’s 261 feet – imagine four bowling lanes laid end to end.

It will also dwarf the Antonov An-225, the heaviest aircraft ever built, which was destroyed at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The aircraft’s scale might be groundbreaking, but the engineering is not – and that’s by design. Radia says it’s focusing “on existing technology and safety by using, where applicable, tried-and-true aviation materials, components and fabrication techniques that have FAA [US Federal Aviation Administration] approval, are already in mass production and are lowest-risk.”

The idea is to hit the ground running with a fast, well-built fleet that meets aerospace industry standards. Online reports say commercial operations as soon as 2027, but there’s no timeline confirmed on Radia’s website. CNN has reached out to the company for comment.

Radia has patented a system for loading blades into WindRunner. Radia

There she blows

Radia is banking on research organisation Bloomberg NEF’s estimation that up to $10 trillion will be spent on onshore wind through 2050. The development of WindRunner is to enable GigaWind, the XXL turbines made by Radia’s partners, which include five of the world’s top six turbine manufacturers.

Currently, turbine blades today are ordinarily 230 feet or less (70 meters), but Radia wants to deploy blades of up to 104 meters (341 feet). The company says GigaWind turbines could potentially be two to three times more powerful – and two to three times more profitable than those typically deployed today.

So who are the folks behind these ambitious claims? The founder and CEO is Mark Lundstrum, a cross-industry entrepreneur and MIT aerospace engineer who founded Radia in 2016. The company says its team of advisers include former top brass from Boeing, MIT, Rolls-Royce and the FAA, as well as former US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull.

It’s an impressive lineup and the decision to focus on safe, existing technology is a smart one. Might we see a WindRunner take off before the end of the decade? Could its distinctive shape one day be as popular as the Beluga XL transporter planes created by Airbus? Watch the skies.",https://edition.cnn.com
44,Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter: The latest developments on the gambling and ‘massive theft’ allegations,"CNN —

Major League Baseball and the Internal Revenue Service are investigating amid allegations surrounding Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani and his longtime interpreter Ippei Mizuhara.

The investigations are underway just two days after Mizuhara, a longtime interpreter for the Japanese baseball superstar, was fired after the player’s lawyers accused him of “massive theft” of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookmaker under federal investigation, according to ESPN and the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story.

“Major League Baseball has been gathering information since we learned about the allegations involving Shohei Ohtani and Ippei Mizuhari from the news media,” the league said in a news release. “Earlier today, our Department of Investigations (DOI) began their formal process investigating the matter.”

The IRS Criminal Investigation Los Angeles Field Office is investigating both Mizuhara and Mathew Bowyer, IRS spokesperson Scott Villiard told CNN on Friday. Bowyer is a California resident whose bankruptcy court documents show had gambling debts of $425,000 more than a decade ago. Diane Bass, an attorney for Bowyer, told CNN her client “never had any contact with Mr. Ohtani.”

Ohtani’s attorneys have not detailed how they believe the funds were stolen, fueling questions about the scandal that emerged as Ohtani made his much-anticipated debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters Ohtani will address the media on Monday amid the scandal.

The saga began with reporters asking questions about alleged wire transfers from Ohtani’s bank account and culminated in Mizuhara’s firing. Here’s how the scandal unfolded:

• Mizuhara told ESPN in a Tuesday interview arranged by Ohtani’s representative that Ohtani had no involvement in his betting and that Mizuhara asked the player last year to pay off his gambling debt, ESPN reported.

• But after the interview, Ohtani’s spokesperson “disavowed” Mizuhara’s account, then released a statement saying Ohtani had been the victim of theft.

• On the same day, Mizuhara was seen smiling in the LA dugout and talking to Ohtani before translating for the star in the team’s 5-2 win over the San Diego Padres in the MLB season-opening game in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday.

• Later on Wednesday, Mizuhara was fired as Ohtani’s interpreter. The pair had been working together since 2013.

• After learning about the allegations against Ohtani and Mizuhara, MLB announced it would be pursuing an investigation on Friday. The IRS also confirmed it was investigating the translator.

• In an interview with CNN on Saturday, an attorney for Bowyer, the former bookmaker under investigation in connection to the controversy, said Bowyer “never met” or had “any direct contact” with Ohtani.

Former bookmaker ‘only did business’ with interpreter, attorney says

Bowyer’s attorney, Bass, told CNN in an interview Saturday that the only person the former bookmaker “did business” with was Mizuhara.

“Mathew Bowyer never spoke with or emailed with or texted with or had any contact whatsoever with Shohei Ohtani,” Bass told CNN.

Bowyer met Mizuhara after a Padres game in San Diego in 2022, according to Bass.

Bass told CNN she does not know how often Mizuhara placed bets or how much he bet, but said Bowyer told her that Mizuhara placed bets regularly on “primarily soccer, occasionally football and basketball, but it was never baseball.”

Mizuhara told ESPN on Tuesday, “I never bet on baseball…That’s 100 percent. I knew that rule…We have a meeting about that in spring training.”

Mizuhara’s gambling “got out of hand at a certain point,” but “he was making regular payments for a significant amount of time,” Bass said.

Asked if the payments were coming from Mizuhara’s or Ohtani’s account, Bass replied, “I honestly don’t know how many transfers came from which account(s), [or] whether it was more than one account. I don’t have access to that information,” she told CNN.

When discussing Ohtani’s name on “one of the wire transfers to Bowyer’s organization to cover a bet,” Bass said, “as far as Mr. Bowyer understood, the bet was from Ippei, or it was being covered by Mr. Ohtani for Ippei.”

CNN has sought comment from Mizuhara and Ohtani’s agent.

Bass emphasized that while Bowyer is under federal investigation, he has not been charged with a crime. She said Bowyer stopped his bookmaking operation in October 2023 when “feds showed up at his house.”

$4.5 million transferred from Ohtani’s accounts, ESPN reports

ESPN’s Tisha Thompson, citing unnamed sources, said on CNN’s “The Lead” Wednesday at least $4.5 million was withdrawn via wire transfer from Ohtani’s bank accounts, though it is unclear who initiated the transfers.

Thompson also reports sources told her Mizuhara’s sports betting dates back as early as 2021, when Ohtani was playing for the Los Angeles Angels.

When reached for comment, the Angels referred all questions to the Dodgers and Shohei’s representatives.

Ohtani played his last game with the Angels last year before signing a record-breaking 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers.

The Dodgers confirmed Mizuhara’s firing and said they are “aware of media reports and are gathering information.” The team added it had no further comment.

Shifting statements

As news of Mizuhara’s firing and alleged actions unfolded, both the interpreter and Ohtani’s representatives have shifted their statements given to ESPN reporters – first saying the star player was aware of his translator’s gambling debt and later that he had no knowledge or involvement.

ESPN’s Thompson said the interpreter and Ohtani’s representatives did “a big 180” in what they were telling her.

At first, Ohtani’s spokesperson told ESPN the player had transferred money to help pay off Mizuhara’s gambling debts, the outlet reported. In a Tuesday interview with ESPN, the translator said Ohtani was unhappy with the situation but agreed to pay the debt.

Mizuhara also said that he never bet on MLB games and denied Ohtani had any involvement.

Then on Wednesday, Ohtani’s law firm, Berk Brettler LLP, released a statement saying, “In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities.”

That same day, Mizuhara admitted lying about Ohtani being aware of his debts, Thompson said. He walked back much of his initial story, saying instead that Ohtani had no knowledge of the interpreter’s debts and had made no payments, ESPN reported.

Mizuhara apologized to the team after the Dodgers’ game in Seoul Wednesday, according to ESPN, citing an unnamed Dodgers official.

“I’ve been told (Mizuhara) says something to the effect of ‘I’m sorry. I apologize. I have a gambling problem,’” Thompson said on ESPN.

Ohtani and Mizuhara first worked together from 2013 to 2017 when Mizuhara served as a translator for the Nippon-Ham Fighters, Ohtani’s team with Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball League, according to MLB.com. When Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, he asked Mizuhara to join him as his translator in the rookie season, and Mizuhara eventually followed the star to the Dodgers.",https://edition.cnn.com
45,LA Lakers post highest point total since 1987 in historic scoring night against Indiana Pacers,"CNN —

The Los Angeles Lakers produced their highest scoring night in 37 years on Monday, outlasting the Indiana Pacers 150-145 in a clash between two potent offenses.

The Lakers, led by the superstar duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis, had four players score at least 25 points in what was the team’s highest scoring game of the season.

Davis led the way with 36 points and 16 rebounds while shooting an efficient 15-of-21 from the field. James and Spencer Dinwiddie each had 26 points while Austin Reaves chipped in with 25, including six free throws inside the final minute to help ice the game.

Per the NBA, these four players became the first quartet of teammates to each score 25+ points in over three years, and the first Lakers teammates to achieve the feat since 1971.

Indiana held a six-point lead after the first quarter before a scoring explosion from LA saw the team put up 86 points across the second and third quarters alone.

“Offensively, we were very sharp,” James said postgame. “We had some turnovers in the first quarter and first half but cleaned it up in the second half.”

The Pacers, meanwhile, had all five starters – and eight players in total – hit double figures after a late fourth-quarter rally saw the team fall just short. Indiana has boasted one of the best offenses in the league throughout the season and currently holds the second-best offensive rating in the league.

“We played (the Pacers) in the (In-Season Tournament) championship, and we know how high-powered an offense they are,” said James. “They’re never going to stop playing no matter how far they get down or how far they’re up, so it’s a good win for us.”

Despite the free-scoring nature of the game, Davis lamented his side’s defensive performance.

“We allowed them to score 145, so … it was terrible defensively,” Davis said after the game.

“They hit some shots toward the end, but we can do what we want offensively – as you could see tonight – but we’ve got to defend, especially when we’ve got a team (in trouble) like that. We don’t need to give them life, but at this point in the season, a win is a win. We’ll take it, but we’ve got to learn from it as well.”

The Lakers were almost made to pay for their porous defense, as the Pacers came back from 19 points down to cut the lead to only three when All-Star Tyrese Haliburton drilled two triples inside the final 30 seconds of the game.

The late flurry turned out to be too little, too late for Indiana, but head coach Rick Carlisle was pleased with his squad’s effort.

“Sometimes, when you have difficult challenges, it’s easy to drop your head and just say, ‘Hey, it’s not our night,’ but our guys don’t do that,” he said. “Our second unit battled in the second half. That last five-minute stretch, the first unit came back in there, and they were defiant about hanging in the game. At a certain point, you’ve got to play absolutely perfectly, and that was going to be very, very difficult.”

Carlisle was also unimpressed with the disparity in foul calls between the two sides.

“There were just certain things that were impossible to overcome. A 27 free throw differential is one, and a 17-foul differential is the other,” he said.

Mid-season trade acquisition Pascal Siakam led the Pacers in scoring with 36 points to go along with 12 rebounds, while Myles Turner and Andrew Nembhard contributed 20 and 15 points respectively as the Pacers fell to 40-32 – currently good enough for sixth in the Eastern Conference.

The Purple and Gold, meanwhile, win their third in a row to move to 39-32 and occupy the No. 9 seed in the West and a spot in the postseason Play-In Tournament. The Lakers now embark on a six-game road-trip and will be looking to improve their seeding and secure an automatic playoff berth as the season winds down.",https://edition.cnn.com
46,Kim Mulkey: No. 3 LSU advances to women’s March Madness Sweet 16 amid distraction surrounding head coach,"CNN —

The No. 3 seeded LSU Tigers held off No. 11 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders to advance to the women’s March Madness Sweet 16 on Sunday, amid distractions surrounding head coach Kim Mulkey.

The defending champions overcame a slow start to easily beat Middle Tennessee 83-56 at Pete Maravich Assembly Center to make the Sweet 16 round for the second straight year.

But, LSU’s March Madness campaign has been overshadowed by a spat between Mulkey and the Washington Post.

Mulkey said a reporter for the newspaper has been attempting to interview her for the last two years. She claims the reporter contacted the school on Tuesday, sending more than a dozen questions to answer by Thursday, as the team was preparing for its first-round game.

While Mulkey has been highly critical of the Washington Post, she has not divulged the nature of the story that the Post has been working on, or why she is attacking the Post for a story that has not published.

A Washington Post spokesperson declined to comment on Mulkey’s remarks, which were made before LSU’s win.

Following the team’s victory on Sunday, Mulkey denied the team’s sluggish first half came as a result of the team being distracted from the off-the-court noise.

“Listen, man, we’re not going to let one sleazy reporter distract us from what we’re trying to do. Absolutely not,” Mulkey said after reaching the 17th Sweet 16 round of her career.

“My kids didn’t even know I said that yesterday. That team is not involved in this. They were in shock when they saw all that on the internet.”

The Tigers trailed by four points going into halftime, but came out firing in the second period, galvanized by the defense of guard Hailey Van Lith.

From that, the team’s offense sprung into life, with LSU outscoring Middle Tennessee 51-20 in the second half.

Angel Reese recorded her 14th consecutive double-double – her 25th of the season – with 20 points and 11 rebounds, while Flau’Jae Johnson added 21 points.

Aneesah Morrow also had a double-double with 19 points and 13 rebounds and Mikaylah Williams had 16 points to seal a victory which ended the Blue Raiders’ 20-game winning run.

“I didn’t want to let my team down,” Reese said afterwards. “I didn’t want this to be my last game being here in the PMAC. So I did whatever it takes to win. And me and Coach have that kind of relationship where she can get on me and talk to me, like, I need you, and give me that encouragement that I need.”

LSU’s qualification for the Sweet 16 is the 16th time the team has done so in the program’s history and the first time since 2013-14 that it has done it in back-to-back seasons.

The Tigers will face either No. 2 UCLA or No. 7 Creighton on Saturday, March 30 in the next round.

After Sunday’s victory, freshman guard Johnson paid tribute to the 12,632 strong crowd in attendance at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center and the inspiration they gave the team.

“I couldn’t hear at one point at PMAC,” Johnson told reporters. “I didn’t hear the play calls. I couldn’t hear what was going on. It was so much fun.

“I love playing here at LSU and everything going on. It was so much fun. Now to be able to advance in my second year here, it’s just amazing. I wish we could take this crowd and bring it everywhere we go, but I know they’re going to come to Albany, and I hope to see everybody in Albany.”",https://edition.cnn.com
47,Andre Lima vs. Igor Severino: UFC fighter disqualified for biting opponent,"CNN —

UFC fighter Igor Severino was disqualified from his fight on Saturday night after biting his opponent, Andre Lima.

In the second round of their flyweight bout in Las Vegas, Lima was being held from behind by Severino before the 20-year-old appeared to lean in and bite Lima on his left arm.

Lima let out an audible shout before referee Chris Tognoni stopped the fight and announced that Severino had been disqualified from the fight, awarding the win to Lima.

Lima posed for photos after his victory, with a bite mark visible on his left arm.

According to martial arts journalist Kevin Iole, UFC president Dana White said in a text message that Severino had been released from the organization following the disqualification.

“Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters,” White said, according to Iole.

“If you get frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but the worst thing you can do is bite your opponent.

“Now you get cut and lose the biggest opportunity of your life. Not to mention, he’s going to have real problems with the NSAC (Nevada State Athletic Commission).”

Lima didn’t appear too bothered by the incident though, posting on Instagram in the hours after his fight that he had got a tattoo of the bite to commemorate it. The tattoo is in the same location as the original bite and appears to recreate the bitemarks left on his arm from Severino.

White appeared impressed by Lima’s tattoo, posting on his Instagram story that he would double the Brazilian’s fight bonus to $50,000, saying: “This is AWESOME.”

The UFC’s own social media accounts humorously commemorated the moment, coining Lima’s fight the “bite of the night,” a play on their more traditional “fight of the night” accolade.

“I was able to hit him really hard, but then he bit me when I was trying to take him down. That’s why I yelled,” Lima said in the octagon after his fight.

It was an unconventional way for Lima to earn his first UFC victory as he was making his debut in the competition on Saturday.

48,The painter reframing ‘dandies’ for the female gaze,"CNN —

Writing in 1863, the French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire turned his eye to a striking faction of Parisian and English high society, one militantly fanatical for appearances — so much that some were said to polish their boots with Champagne. “Dandyism is a mysterious institution,” he said of the cult of the fastidiously-dressed, 19th-century male, “no less peculiar than the duel.”

Though himself no stranger to decadence — with a predilection for satin, velvet and changing his hair on a whim, Baudelaire squandered an inheritance with his louche taste for clothing and opium — he identified in the dandy’s subversive character a “burning desire to create a personal form of originality.”

Scores of subcultures have embraced and interpreted the archetype in the decades since. Rather than Beau Brummell’s crisply-tied cravat, today the term “dandy” may summon visions of Harry Styles in a string of freshwater pearls or playwright Jeremy O. Harris’ natty Thom Browne suiting. But its preening, self-curated elegance remains, beyond limits of the gender binary or preconceived notions of how one “should” dress.

“There’s not one definitive description,” observed the British artist Sarah Ball in a video call with CNN. “Gender norms are so blurred now, fantastically. It’s a moving scale, wherever we choose to be.”

The concept of the dandy in the twenty-first century — and how it may be defined or disrupted — is the connective thread of Ball’s first New York solo exhibition, “Tilted,” which debuted at Stephen Friedman Gallery in Tribeca earlier this year. Comprising 10 large-scale, tightly composed portraits in Ball’s signature airy stretches of color, the show challenges conventions of gender and celebrates the exuberance of self-expression.

Each of the personalities represented in “Tilted” is dressed in their own idiosyncratic accoutrements, rendered in minute detail: rakish beribboned headgear, delicate lace collars and bonnets, expressive makeup, oversized eyewear and, in one instance, even a cocktail glass, holding a slosh of liquid and the briny green of a Castelvetrano olive. Ball — who works from a studio in the small English town of St Ives, Cornwall, where artists have been drawn to the light and the sea for generations — typically finds her subjects through social media or on the street, attracted by their “degree of complete individuality,” she told CNN.

Exploring the dandy persona has been a natural development for Ball, whose work needles the tension between self-identity and the performance of outward presentation. “It’s part of a much bigger idea: how we are defined by others or how we define ourselves. That can be anything — race, ethnicity, or religion, or sexuality or gender fluidity,” she told CNN. “I’ve always been very interested in how we present a version of ourselves externally; how our personality manifests itself.”

For all the wit in the clothes, there is a stillness and a surreal quality in Ball’s portraits that place her subjects slightly out of time. “That is definitely something I seek when I’m looking for people to paint,” she said. Indelible personal style is also crucial to the allure. Ball doesn’t costume her subjects, though she edits details to balance the composition. “They’re ready-made, in a way,” she explained, “but then the painting really does take over.”

At over eight feet tall, “Declan (In Simone Rocha With Eddie),” depicts an individual in a sumptuous, crystal-embroidered smock dress by the Irish designer, known for her rebellious take on historic ritual, “feminine” codes and gender play. Accompanied by their long-haired guinea pig Eddie, swaddled in a lace-edged handkerchief, Declan’s coiffed shag haircut could read 18th century Flanders — or any contemporary hipster enclave, be it in Brooklyn or Berlin.

An encounter with the writer Andrew Solomon’s 2004 essay Dandyism, published years before Instagram and other social media became the de facto avenue for exhibitionist display, influenced the body of work, according to Ball. “I’ve always looked (at) and used historical archives as a way of connecting with what’s happening in the world at the moment,” Ball said. “It’s a bit tongue in cheek, but the idea of ‘promenade’ in showing oneself peacocking is the same as people use social media for, really.” (Cue Solomon, quoting the French novelist Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly, “To appear to be is to be for Dandies.”)

Two figures in the show, Von and Henry, materialize in multiple guises, demonstrating the transformativeness of persona construction and the depth of what may lie beyond the surface. “I’m aware that Instagram allows us to curate an image, an idea of ourselves, but unless you know that person, you don’t really ever know whether that’s true,” Ball noted. “There’s that intersection where truth meets fiction.”

Her interpretations on the dandy shows how mutable and fluid the persona is, as Ball name-checks a series of female inspirations for the ‘look;’ the outré trouser suits and cropped bobs introduced by designer Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel, screen cipher Marlene Dietrich and Sandy Powell, the flame-haired, bespectacled costume designer known for her collaborations with directors Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes.

What remains is pure individual verve. “I’ve always been drawn to people that have not followed one path or another…who are extroverts, theatrical, unusual, creative, and wonderful,” Ball said.",https://edition.cnn.com
49,Emily Ratajkowski has changed her engagement ring into two ‘divorce rings’,"CNN —

Diamonds are forever – especially for Emily Ratajkowski, who has chosen to turn her engagement ring into something entirely new following her split from her film producer husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard.

With the help of Alison Chemla, creative director of jewelry brand Alison Lou, Ratajkowski worked to remake her old engagement ring, which featured a pear-shaped and a princess-cut diamond, into two separate rings.

“The rings represent my own personal evolution,” the model told Vogue. “I don’t think a woman should be stripped of her diamonds just because she’s losing a man.”

Now, the pear-shaped diamond sits on Ratajkowski’s pinkie finger, while the princess cut has been flanked by more trapezoid stones and turned into a new sparkler.

Ratajkowski went on to explain that she got the idea after reading Stephanie Danler’s story “The Unravelers” in The Paris Review.

Ratajkowski told Vogue she was inspired by a story in The Paris Review in which the author writes of a grandmother's ring made of stones from her previous marriages. From Emily Ratajkowski/Instagram

“(It) includes the story of her grandmother’s snake ring—a ring that is made up of the different stones from her various marriages,” said Ratajkowski, who was catapulted to fame after she appeared in the music video for Robin Thicke’s 2013 track “Blurred Lines.”

“I loved the idea of a ring unabashedly representing the many lives a woman has lived.”

The model, who shares a son with Bear-McClard, added that creating the rings was a “fun project” to work on “amidst a hugely transitional period in my life.”

“The ring became symbolic to me—some kind of token or evidence of my life becoming my own again,” she said.

“Somehow, these rings feel like a reminder that I can make myself happy in ways I never imagined,” she added.",https://edition.cnn.com

More than 4,000 culturally significant items, including textiles, ceramics, and clothing, have been repatriated to Peru, their country of origin, the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

The 4,600 cultural assets were returned to the South American country from the United States and countries across Europe including Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, the foreign ministry said Wednesday.

According to the statement, Peru’s Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Foreign Affairs worked alongside local authorities, consulates and embassies in the countries where the objects were located to bring them back to Peru.

Of the items returned, 4,556 came from a collection of archaeological material belonging to the late American archaeologist and anthropologist John Rowe, the statement said. Another 33 were returned from Italy – 21 of which were previously seized by Italian authorities from an art gallery, the statement continued. Among these items were clothing and ceramics from the Nazca, Wari, Inca, Paracas and Chimú cultures, it said.

A silver incense burner from the 18th or 19th century was returned from Portugal, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, and other archaeological items were voluntarily returned from Germany and the Netherlands. Swiss authorities also seized and repatriated four pieces of pre-Hispanic ceramics, the statement continued.

Celebrated architect Norman Foster has unveiled plans for a new $1-billion office tower in ﻿Los Angeles that will see greenery spilling out from a series of terraces spiraling up its facade.

The eye-catching proposal, which was formally submitted to city planning authorities this week, will transform a two-acre site on Hollywood’s Sunset Boulevard into a 22-story entertainment industry workplace dubbed The Star.

Digital impressions of the high-rise, released by the British architect’s firm Foster + Partners on Wednesday, show elevated gardens bursting with plants and trees, as well as outdoor decks and modern office space.

In a statement, Foster described it as a “true reflection of the workplace of the future, nurturing community, wellbeing and collaboration.”

Comprised largely of offices and billed as “a modern landmark,” The Star will house entertainment firms and “Hollywood’s top content creators,” said Foster + Partners. Current plans include production space, a gallery, a screening theater, a rooftop restaurant and “community gathering spaces” at ground level.

The proposal, which is set across 525,000 square feet of floor space, replaces an earlier plan for the site unveiled in 2019. Designed by MAD Architects, the Chinese firm behind the curvilinear Lucas Museum of Narrative Art (which is set to open in LA next year), the original circular design featured a funicular railway wrapping around the exterior.

The scheme was reportedly set to cost $500 million, half the price of the new proposal. Asked why the tower’s developer, Maggie Gong Miracle, abandoned the original plan, a spokesperson for the project told CNN that Foster’s new design — which is the same height, but thinner than the previous proposal — was intended to be an “asset to the community” that “respected the views” enjoyed by those living in the Hollywood Hills, which overlook the site.

The announcement comes as LA’s real estate market struggles to recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hollywood writers strikes and the growth of remote and hybrid working. More than a quarter of the city’s office space — rising to almost 30% in downtown LA — is currently vacant, according to the latest data from property brokerage Savills.

52,Polly Braden spent two years documenting life for the women forced to leave Ukraine,"CNN —

Within hours of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky invoked martial law across the country, setting in motion an ongoing defence operation and signing a decree to mobilize conscripts. With eligible men aged between 18-60 not being allowed to leave Ukraine, news reports were filled with images of mostly women and young children fleeing the country, wrapped in blankets or with grandparents nearby.

Like many of us, in the early days of the war, British photographer Polly Braden’s grasp of what was happening was informed by TV and newspaper coverage. In it, she recognized the correlation between what she was witnessing and her own practice. “I’d made this body of work about single parents (‘Holding the Baby,’ 2022), and seeing these women leaving Ukraine, I thought about everything they were going to have to do to support the children and older people they were bringing with them,” she told CNN in an interview.

Weeks after those initial reportage images began being shown, Braden flew to Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine, inspired to work on a new series. “It felt important to record what was going to happen to these women. They were going to have to find housing, schooling, jobs… to build new lives,” she explained. “It also meant they suddenly became refugees — they might have been teachers, lawyers, important people in their community — what was that going to look like for them?” The project would ultimately become an exhibition called “Leaving Ukraine,” currently on display at the Foundling Museum in London.

“Of course, it’s important we have pictures of the frontline and what’s happening inside Ukraine, but it’s also important we understand what role women play in war, especially this war, where women have given up their status in their country,” continued Braden, reflecting on the traditionally gendered approach to documenting conflict. “They are safeguarding the next generation of Ukraine.”

Spanning two years (the most recent image was taken in early March 2024) and featuring a mix of still photography and moving image, “Leaving Ukraine” closely follows the stories of six women Braden met when she travelled to Moldova: law graduate Lena, pregnant mother Anya, school friends Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, and Narine who left Ukraine with her children and a close friend.

Conscious of the work’s broader scope, Braden considers “Leaving Ukraine” not just a depiction of these six women and their families, but also as a reflection of the countries they’ve ended up in, which include Italy, Poland and the UK. According to the UNHCR’s most recent report, Moldova has received over 850,000 Ukrainian refugees and more than 120,000 third country nationals since February 22, 2022. Of them, as of November 12, 2023, more than 113,000 have stayed on in the country.

“I thought I’d meet people in a country then follow them building a life there, but not one person I met has landed in a country, found their feet and made it work,” she shared. “They’ve had to move because they can’t find work, there’s no housing, they can’t get their kid to school — or they’ve landed in the countryside in a country they’ve never been to.”

Braden describes the project as wholly collaborative, detailing her close work with the women to construct an intimate portrait of their new reality (photographing Anya, for example, just hours after she gave birth). Many of the images are tender studies of private moments, shot in homes, social spaces and on public transport. “They’ve been telling their own story really, I’ve just been holding a camera,” she said.

Lena, who Braden recalled had become irritated speaking to journalists in Moldova, later came to live with her in London. The photographer noted how they didn’t take any photos during this period. “I thought it was quite invasive,” she said, reflecting on the trust they’d developed. “After all it’s a privilege, (this work). And finding a new life is like a jigsaw, right?” Lena has since moved out, meeting a partner and having a baby, and Braden is conscious of how the war has affected her family’s trajectory. “The child hopefully will speak Ukrainian, but they’re an English family,” she said.

Elsewhere, with two teenagers of her own, the photographer has taken great pleasure in working with the three schoolgirls, one of whom is now studying film in Warsaw and used the project in her coursework. “The most amazing part about following young people, like Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, is they’re optimistic and full of the joys of life,” she said. “Wanting love and all the normal things young people want.”

Initially, Braden had envisioned she’d be able to return to Ukraine with some of the women, but with the war now in its third year, that has not yet been possible. Ultimately she determined that the series is about building a life away from home, and “finding new paths in Europe.”

Similarly, her commitment to just a small group of families, in tandem with her long-term approach, allowed her to harness greater power in her storytelling. “If we don’t look at individual stories,” she clarified, “then big policies are made without understanding details.”",https://edition.cnn.com
53,"Man finds ‘England’s largest’ gold nugget, despite metal detector failing","CNN —

A treasure hunter struggling with faulty equipment has unearthed a gold nugget believed to be the largest ever found in England.

Richard Brock discovered the gold nugget, weighing 64.8 grams (2.3 ounces), in the country’s Shropshire Hills near the border with Wales, auction house Mullock Jones said Thursday.

The nugget is around the size of a UK 50 pence coin.

The find, nicknamed Hiro’s Nugget, has an estimated worth of between £30,000 ($38,000) and £40,000 ($50,700), according to Shropshire-based Mullock Jones, which is handling the sale.

However, it almost seemed that luck had eluded Brock, whose equipment almost failed him on the day of the dig.

When Brock arrived at the site in Shropshire in May, he discovered that his metal detector was faulty, according to a press release from Mullock Jones.

As his hopes dimmed, he turned to a piece of older equipment. At first he found only a coin of little value, but within five minutes he made the shocking discovery, the auction house said.

“It just goes to show that it doesn’t really matter what equipment you use, if you are walking over the find and are alert enough to what might be lurking underneath the soil, that makes all the difference,” Brock said in the release.

The nugget is considered to be a “rare find,” auctioneer Ben Jones of Mullock Jones told CNN Thursday. How it made it to the dig site is a mystery.

Parts of the Shropshire Hills were once under a prehistoric ocean, and pieces of coral are often unearthed there, according to the auction house.

“The site does contain an old road/ railway line and has remnants of Welsh stone within,” auctioneer Jones said, adding: “So [there’s] a variety of possibilities of how it made it there.”

The auction ends April 1.

Although Hiro’s Nugget is believed to be the largest discovered so far in England, several previous finds in other parts of the United Kingdom dwarf it in size.

He is the author of “The Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

CNN —

If ISIS was indeed responsible for the attack Friday at a Moscow-area concert venue that killed at least 133 people, it would suggest that, unfortunately, the terror group is making something of a comeback.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack; a US official told CNN the US has no reason to doubt it.

Back in its heyday of 2014 and 2015, ISIS had controlled territory in Iraq and Syria around the size of the United Kingdom and a population of millions of people. During that period, the group also carried out a number of terrorist plots in Europe, including an attack in Paris that killed 130 people in 2015. ISIS had also inspired terrorists in the US, including the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 in what was then the most lethal terrorist attack in the US since 9/11.

But between 2017 and 2018, ISIS lost its so-called geographical “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria, and it has since devolved into a loosely allied group of ISIS affiliates in Africa and Asia with seemingly scant capabilities to carry out large-scale attacks elsewhere.

One of the most virulent affiliates is ISIS-K in Afghanistan, which killed 13 American service members and some 170 Afghan civilians at Kabul Airport as the Biden administration pulled all US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021.

Yet, the understanding at the time was that ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan and certain African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Somalia were not capable of carrying out major international attacks. But then came a large-scale terrorist attack in Iran in January that killed 84 people at a memorial service commemorating General Qasem Soleimani, one of the most powerful military leaders in Iran who had been killed by a US drone strike in 2020. Through that attack, ISIS-K showed that the group, which is very anti-Shia, could target a hostile state like predominantly Shia Iran.

In March alone, a Russian state news agency said the country had thwarted multiple ISIS-related incidents, including a plan to attack a synagogue in Moscow.

The US embassy in Russia also said on March 7 that it was “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow,” including concerts. According to a US National Security Council spokesperson, “The US Government also shared this information with Russian authorities in accordance with its longstanding ‘duty to warn’ policy.” But Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the US’ warning as “provocative,” saying, “These actions resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society.”

Taken together, the fact that Russian authorities had detected a number of ISIS-related plots earlier this month and that US authorities were warning of an attack at the same time indicates that there was an active terrorist threat in Moscow from ISIS that was known not only to the US but also to the Russians.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin linked the suspects in Friday’s attack to Ukraine during a five-minute address on Saturday. State news agencies said that authorities arrested the four men suspected of attacking the Moscow-area concert venue while they were trying to cross the border into Ukraine, and that they “had relevant contacts on the Ukrainian side,” according to the FSB.

Ukraine has emphatically denied any role in the attack, and both Ukrainian and American officials expressed concerns that Putin’s comments may be used to justify an escalation in the ongoing war.

ISIS-K certainly has the capability and motive to attack Russia. When it comes to motive, the Russian support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, which helped him remain in power during the Syrian civil war, certainly comes to mind. For ISIS, Assad is a mortal enemy, both because he is a member of a Shia sect and because he has systematically killed Sunnis in Syria. Also, historically, Russia has brutally repressed Muslim minorities like the Chechens. As for capability, the ISIS-K attack in Iran earlier this year demonstrated that the group could carry out a large-scale attack outside of its home base in Afghanistan.

What we do know is that Putin made a glaring mistake by denouncing the US’ warning. And if ISIS-K did attack the concert hall, the Biden administration would have to ask itself some serious questions about whether the decision to pull all American troops out of Afghanistan allowed ISIS to regroup there with the capability to carry out large-scale attacks in other countries. If that were the case, that would be a blow for the Biden administration.",https://edition.cnn.com
55,"Opinion: As a cancer survivor, I feel for Kate Middleton","Editor’s Note: Sara Stewart is a film and culture writer who lives in western Pennsylvania. The views expressed here are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

As news that Catherine, Princess of Wales had announced her cancer diagnosis dominated headlines Friday, I felt a deep and traumatic solidarity. Recovering from major abdominal surgery — as Kate has been since January — is ghastly, and having to do it so you can be healthy enough for chemotherapy is a humbling one-two punch from the universe. For Kate, that’s topped off by having to endure it all while the entire world chases you down like a fox on one of those hunts the royals are always throwing.

Sara Stewart Todd Thompson

Kate has not yet disclosed specifically what kind of cancer she has. An oncologist told Today.com that it could be colon, stomach, genital or urinary cancer. We know that rates of colon cancer diagnoses in particular are going up alarmingly in younger populations. I was 45 when I received my diagnosis of stage 3 colon cancer, and, like Kate, underwent major abdominal surgery followed by chemo. I was told by countless doctors and nurses that they were seeing an upsetting uptick in younger patients like me.

One of the first things health care providers recommend to aid your recovery from surgery is reducing your stress. I truly cannot imagine trying to deal with the indignities of post-surgical recovery — such as, in my case not being able to walk even a single block unassisted for weeks, or being incontinent when you used to be a normal healthy person — on top of the relentless scrutiny Kate’s been under since that unnecessary photoshopped image.

But I do know this: She is in a unique position to be a much-needed voice for people around the world dealing with cancer at a young age. As a survivor of a gastrointestinal cancer, whose sufferers face much greater stigma than other types of cancer, I feel this most acutely. Kate is someone with a global public profile whose voice can truly make a difference in, for example, advocating for younger people to get colonoscopies and other cancer screenings. For the development of blood tests to detect gastrointestinal and other hard-to-detect cancers. And for health care providers to get on board with more modern practices, like the study that just found it’s unnecessary for people to starve themselves on a liquid diet the day before a colonoscopy.

I just celebrated my five-year cancerversary, which is to say I’ve been cancer-free since I finished a course of chemotherapy in February 2019. People ask me how I’m feeling now, and when I answer, I make sure to throw in details like “I’m definitely going to be advocating for more public restroom access from now on!” and “My digestive system will never be the same, but I’m happy to be alive!”

Maybe this makes me a Debbie Downer, but I’m fine with risking that to call attention to the fact that colon cancer survivors are often dealing with a very different version of “healthy” than the world might prefer to think about.

Depending on the nature of her abdominal surgery, Kate might have been assigned a short-term or a permanent colostomy bag. If she was lucky enough not to, she’s very likely dealing with all kinds of abdominal distress nonetheless. And although I cannot stress enough that she owes absolutely nothing to the public while she goes through treatment, my fervent hope is that once she’s on the other side of it she’ll become a powerful voice advocating for more ways of early testing and destigmatization.

Having cancer is not elegant. It is not sophisticated. I’m sure it’s the kind of thing the royal family would rather never, ever think about. But it’s landed squarely in their midst regardless, so this is Kate’s chance to make a real difference in the health outcomes of countless people around the world.

Here’s to a speedy and minimally awful course of chemotherapy, Kate. If you ever want to swap caustic bathroom humor with a fellow survivor, you’re always welcome to come sit next to me.",https://edition.cnn.com
56,Opinion: Trump’s image is on the line,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

CNN —

In Charles Dickens’ 1850 novel “David Copperfield,” the perpetually indebted Mr. Micawber notes that all he can offer his young lodger is this advice: “Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness.”

By contrast, “Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.”

In that case, “the blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered,” Micawber says, “and in short you are forever floored.” Like Dickens’ own father who gave him the same advice in real life, Micawber is dragged off to debtors’ prison, but he never loses his optimism that “something will turn up.”

Something may turn up for former President Donald Trump. He faces a Monday deadline to post a $464 million bond that would prevent New York Attorney General Letitia James from attempting to seize his assets while he appeals the judgment imposed on him, his sons and his companies in the civil fraud case.

Trump can hope that he’ll succeed in an appeal to reduce the size of the bond, or that somehow the $3 billion he may reap from a public offering of his Truth Social platform can improve his situation, even though his stake is locked up for six months. And, in a post on Truth Social, he boasted of having nearly half a billion in ready cash to put to work in his presidential campaign, while his lawyers insist he can’t post the bond.

Debtors’ prisons are a thing of the past, but the cold hard reality of finance isn’t — if your cash going out exceeds what’s coming in, you have to borrow money, or sell something.

Money has always been integral to the Trump brand, starting decades before he played a billionaire on “The Apprentice.” Trump’s 1987 bestseller “The Art of the Deal”, written with Tony Schwartz, begins, “I don’t do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll ever need. … Deals are my art form.”

Having a lot of money distinguished him from other presidential candidates, Trump contended. “Boasting, as he always has, of being fabulously rich, he told the 2016 voters that his campaign, unlike that of his rival, was completely self-funded,” Frida Ghitis wrote. “That wasn’t true, of course, but his argument was actually correct. Nobody would control him, he claimed, because those who give you money expect something in return. ‘I don’t need anybody’s money,’ Trump said in his June 2015 presidential campaign announcement.”

“Now Trump needs money, a lot of it. What would his creditors or benefactors want in return?…

Dana Summers/Tribune Content Agency

“In addition to nearly half a billion dollars in judgments, Trump faces massive legal fees over multiple civil and criminal cases, and his presidential campaign funds, drained after funding his personal legal costs, are badly lagging behind President Joe Biden’s massive war chest.”

“Anyone who thinks America’s foes are not paying attention to what could become an entry gate for a Trojan Horse is suffering from wishful thinking.”

As Julian Zelizer noted, “The problem for Trump is that as his legal expenses and obligations are piling up, his fundraising efforts have been lagging. His leadership political action committee, Save America, spent nearly $5.6 million in legal fees in February alone. And while the super PAC Maga Inc. has refunded nearly all of that money, that’s money that could have been used for Trump’s campaign.”

“It doesn’t help that there is a growing fundraising gap between Trump and Biden. Right now, President Biden’s campaign coffers are overflowing. … In a campaign where a relatively small percentage of swing voters in a handful of states will likely determine the outcome, turnout and advertising buys will have an outsized impact. Biden’s financial strength has allowed his campaign to unleash a torrent of blistering ads in swing states, targeting core voters such as Latinos.”

Bill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency

Trump faces trial in a New York courtroom next month over a $130,000 “hush money” payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. In a new documentary on Peacock, Ana Marie Cox wrote, Daniels tells her story. Raised by her mother in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, “she began her career as a stripper at the age of 17, acted in her first adult film in 2002 and soon branched into writing and directing. In July 2006, she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament and says that the two had sex that weekend. Trump has denied being sexually involved with Daniels…”

“As an adult filmmaker, Daniels probably understands objectification better than most and she’s used every tool at her disposal to move from object to subject in this scenario. This is a story about her, and not what Trump did to her. Daniels’ greatest contribution to the movement against Trump is her commitment to her own humanity. In the face of dehumanization, staying true to ourselves is the most powerful statement in the world.”

Trump’s former trade adviser, Peter Navarro, began a four-month prison sentence last week for contempt of Congress. He’s not the first Trump associate to go behind bars, SE Cupp pointed out. “Indeed, working for Donald Trump seems to come with some serious personal and professional liability – expect to lawyer up, expect to have to lie for him, expect to have to cover his tracks,” she said.

After months of negotiations and intraparty squabbles, Speaker Mike Johnson did last week what his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy did when he was nominally in charge of the House Republicans — rely on votes from Democrats to pass spending bills. Following in Rep. Matt Gaetz’ footsteps, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Johnson, though it’s unclear if it will come to a vote.

Terror attack in Russia

ISIS claimed responsibility for a terror attack at a Moscow-area concert venue, killing at least 133 people. If ISIS was indeed behind the attack, it would represent another sign of the group’s return from oblivion, after losing its “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria and devolving into a loosely allied group of affiliates, Peter Bergen wrote.

“ISIS-K certainly has the capability and motive to attack Russia. When it comes to motive, the Russian support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, which helped him remain in power during the Syrian civil war, certainly comes to mind. For ISIS, Assad is a mortal enemy, both because he is a member of a Shia sect and because he has systematically killed Sunnis in Syria.

“Also, historically, Russia has brutally repressed Muslim minorities like the Chechens. As for capability, the ISIS-K attack in Iran earlier this year demonstrated that the group could carry out a large-scale attack outside of its home base in Afghanistan.” Bergen noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly castigated the US for its warning on March 7 of extremists having “imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow.”

How Boeing lost its way

Boeing, one of the two major passenger aircraft makers in the world, is struggling to right itself. “The situation at Boeing is grim,” wrote aviation consultant Richard Aboulafia. “Serious program execution problems and high-profile safety incidents, with still-fresh memories of the two 737 MAX disasters in 2018 and 2019, are damaging the company’s brand and bringing increased regulatory scrutiny. Its recovery won’t begin until management starts examining how the company got here.”

“Years ago, an excessive focus on financial returns led Boeing to badly neglect two of its greatest resources: its people and its suppliers,” he noted.

While shareholders and senior executives benefited from stock dividends, buybacks and stock-based compensation, “the result of this strategy is plain to see: an under-resourced supply chain, and an equally under-resourced and badly alienated workforce. These have resulted in missed production targets, serious program delays, failed safety audits and embarrassing instances of shoddy workmanship…”

“All is not lost. Boeing still has good people, impressive technologies and great jetliners. The latter are in a duopoly with very high entry barriers, even if Airbus is quickly gaining market share. All that’s needed is a new approach to management at the top.”

A sign of the times

Another major American business, Joann Fabrics and Crafts, filed for bankruptcy last week. Lynda Gorov, descended from a family of Russian-Ukrainian tailors, said the outcome may have been inevitable given shifts in our society, but it’s still a shame. Joann, “founded 81 years ago when my seamstress grandmothers still had young children at home, blamed a post-pandemic sales slump for the downturn. The lockdown saw sales of sewing machines soar and stock sell out. But now that we’re not making our own face masks, or working from home in nearly the same numbers, many of our DIY urges are apparently on the wane.”

“But it’s more than that. … crafting skills used to be commonplace. Parents passed them down and when Silent Generation or early Boomer parents could not or did not, home economics teachers did. Most people (OK, most women) who attended public junior high schools in the 1960s, 1970s or even 1980s learned at least basic sewing skills and could advance them with elective classes in high school. Boys were welcome to attend, too, although I don’t recall any wearing aprons or thimbles alongside me.”

With the rise of fast fashion, “it can be far cheaper and far, far less time consuming to run to the mall and grab something off the rack for yourself or your child than it is to set up the sewing machine and do it yourself. Add up the hours spent knitting a scarf or crocheting a sweater, never mind the cost of materials, and homemade items have become the luxuries and store-bought ones the bargain. Most people I know don’t even mend anymore (and shame on us).”

Kate Middleton’s diagnosis

The announcement was filmed by BBC Studios at Windsor on Wednesday. BBC Studios

Catherine, the Princess of Wales, revealed Friday that she has been diagnosed with cancer, ending months of public speculation about her medical condition.

“I felt a deep and traumatic solidarity,” wrote Sara Stewart, a cancer survivor. “Recovering from major abdominal surgery — as Kate has been since January — is ghastly, and having to do it so you can be healthy enough for chemotherapy is a humbling one-two punch from the universe. For Kate, that’s topped off by having to endure it all while the entire world chases you down like a fox on one of those hunts the royals are always throwing…”

“Although I cannot stress enough that she owes absolutely nothing to the public while she goes through treatment, my fervent hope is that once she’s on the other side of it she’ll become a powerful voice advocating for more ways of early testing and destigmatization.”

Texas law

For a few hours last week, Texas was able to control its own immigration policy, despite more than a century in which the federal government has had sole authority to regulate America’s borders. After the US Supreme Court cleared the way for a controversial Texas law go into effect, a three-judge appeals court panel put the law on hold while it faces a challenge from the Biden administration.

“Whatever the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court decide next, the question for President Joe Biden is what to do now,” wrote Lawrence Downes.

“Biden is the one who has been vilified for not stopping what (Texas Gov. Greg) Abbott, former President Donald Trump and others falsely call an immigrant ‘invasion.’ Despite his low approval rating on the issue, Biden remains the one who is actually responsible for immigration policy while demagogues like Abbott and Trump denigrate immigrants with violent and dehumanizing language and whip themselves and the public into a nativist frenzy.”

“If Texas is going to act this way,” Downes added, “Biden should step up and surge resources to the border — not more troops, but Department of Justice investigators and civil-rights lawyers, to be ready to defend immigrants and brown-skinned Texans (and Arizonans and New Mexicans passing through) against the profiling and other civil-rights violations that are sure to follow in SB 4’s wake. He should do more to protect asylum seekers at the southern border, who deserve safety and due process.”

Gaza

At a Harvard event last month, Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser Jared Kushner remarked that Gaza could have “very valuable” waterfront property and suggested that the people sheltering in the Southern city of Rafah, estimated at 1.4 million, could be moved into Egypt or into Israel’s Negev desert.

“Kushner’s notions are fantasies,” wrote Peter Bergen, “since the Egyptians are not going to accept substantial numbers of Palestinian refugees, let alone the more than one million sheltering in Rafah, something they have made clear repeatedly. Nor is Israel going to accommodate them.”

“The October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel were inexcusable, and Israel had every right to avenge them,” Bergen noted.

“Still, Palestinian rage has been building for years, and Kushner, as then-President Donald Trump’s shadow secretary of state, helped contribute to this, something Kushner seems to be blissfully unaware of.”

Writing from Rafah, journalist Aseel Mousa observed, “After narrowly escaping death in Gaza City and Al-Maghazi, I’m unsure if I’ll survive in Rafah. If we are to avoid total catastrophe, Biden and the international community must act immediately to prevent a full-scale Israeli invasion of Rafah and to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid to enter.”

6% no more?

Drew Sheneman/Tribune Content Agency

By settling a lawsuit, the National Association of Realtors has effectively conceded that the 5-6% commission that agents get from home sellers is no longer sacrosanct. But as sociologist Max Besbris pointed out, that doesn’t mean those rates, which are considerably higher than in many other countries, will go down quickly.

“It is clear that more consumer knowledge and more oversight are both necessary,” Besbris wrote. “It should become standard that agents both in writing and verbally alert new clients that fees are legally negotiable. We need stronger and more expansive training for licensed real estate agents, particularly around their financial and fair-housing obligations, as well as more data collection on real estate agent practices.”

AI unites the world

In a divided world, it’s noteworthy when the 193 member states in the United Nations General Assembly can agree on anything. As US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield wrote, the assembly adopted a US-backed resolution Thursday to create a global approach to living with AI.

“The resolution passed Thursday provides a framework to address challenges head on, with a focus on capacity-building to ensure equitable access to the benefits of AI, and equitable cover from its harms. It lays out the steps countries can take to ensure responsible governance, and protect all individuals — including vulnerable individuals — from discrimination, as well as the ways in which the United Nations itself can use AI to advance human rights and sustainable development.”

“Now comes the hard work of putting those principles not only to paper, but into practice.” Sixty five years ago, Thomas-Greenfield noted, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was shown a machine that could play checkers. She “asked ‘coming generations’ to consider what makes us human, and what it means to interact with new and powerful technology. Today, as we celebrate a milestone in realizing the potential of artificial intelligence, it is not on ‘coming generations,’ but this generation, to continue answering her call — together.”

Caitlin Clark

Walt Handelsman/Tribune Content Agency

Caitlin Clark is on a tear, overshadowing the start of this year’s March Madness college basketball tournament. “The University of Iowa senior, who was born and raised in the state, is the most famous face in her game right now by far,” wrote Amy Bass. “Her impact on viewership and passion for the sport, especially among those who are new to it, has been seismic, and she is featured along with two other top players (South Carolina’s Kamilla Cardoso and UCLA’s Kiki Rice) in an upcoming ESPN+ documentary series, ‘Full Court Press.’”

Clark scored 27 points Saturday, leading the Iowa Hawkeyes to victory in their opening game.

Bass observed, “I feel bad (almost) for all of those rabid ‘Pistol Pete’ Maravich fans who came out of hiding (in a manner reminiscent of all those closet Margaret Court fans who suddenly had something to say about Serena Williams’ stats) when Clark broke the NCAA Division I all-time scoring record previously held by Maravich…”

Clark’s ascendancy comes at a triumphant moment for women’s sports, Bass observed. “A lot of people aren’t just watching women — they’re cheering for them. Because what could be more glorious than seeing boys and girls scrambling after Caitlin Clark, offering her their handmade posters that declare their fandom to the world in hopes that she will scribble her name?”",https://edition.cnn.com

CNN —

Last week, I ditched work one day and went to a matinee at a local AMC theater. It was a Timothée Chalamet movie, because statistically of course it was. “Dune: Part Two” was calling my name. There are few things this movie nerd loves more than a big, loud sci-fi fantasy epic on an IMAX screen.

Sara Stewart Todd Thompson

As you’ve probably heard, the second installment of Denis Villeneuve’s opus is quite long, at two hours and 46 minutes. (Though arguably, that’s the new normal.) But I was ready for that. I’d read up on my optimal pee break moments. I had my popcorn (if not my collectible sex-toy popcorn bucket). I was fired up to go back to Arrakis. (CNN and the distributor of “Dune: Part Two” share a parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

I took my reserved seat and sat down, waiting, like Nicole Kidman is always telling us, for the magic to happen.

Cut to 40 minutes after the start time on my ticket, when we were just watching the opening moments of Kidman’s PSA. Any expectation of “magic” had been sucked out of my soul long ago, starting with the braying Maria Menounos “Noovie” pre-show, cranked up loud enough to drown out any conversation with your friends.

Our actual show time then began with 10 minutes of aggressive ads, followed by a raft of trailers so extensive the entire audience began wearily half-laughing when yet another green preview screen popped up. But our giggles turned into stunned silence by the time we were treated to a second viewing of the trailer for “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.” Perhaps they thought it’d play more winningly the second time? Reader, it did not.

The sheer quantity of previews was obnoxious, but it wasn’t just that: Today’s trailers amount to seeing the majority of a movie’s big moments — long gone are the days of weird and mysterious previews that didn’t spell out every beat of a film. We had essentially watched 10 (or more) entire short films before the actual film we’d come to see. We were exhausted. And the opening credits for our movie hadn’t even rolled yet.

I don’t want to state the ass-numbingly obvious, but nobody wants to sit through more than half an hour of “content” before the nearly three-hour film they paid too much to see. It defies all logic to expect people to fork over more to be bombarded with ads and trailers they can’t mute or forward through the way they’d be able to do at home — where they can also sit on a comfier couch and eat better food. It’s as if big movie chains are responding to the dire warnings about the death of their industry by deciding they’ll simply force-feed their remaining audience as much monetizable property as possible.

I’d like to humbly suggest that they f**k off. What if we all take our movie theater dollars elsewhere — say, to pay to watch new releases at home, where you can nearly always get hold of them, even if it’s for $20 (still far less than what you’ll be paying if you buy even a single movie ticket and some concessions).

Will you miss out on the entrancing sight of Paul Atreides learning to ride a sand worm on an impossibly big screen? Tragically, yes. (It really is quite a cinematic moment.) But I’d argue if AMC, and the other theater chains, and Kidman, believe in delivering us the “magic” of the big-screen experience, the least they can do is make it less sadistic. Treat us like valued customers, not easy marks.

Despite everything I just said, I too still believe in the magic of movies. If you’re lucky enough to live near an Alamo Drafthouse, or another independent movie theater or small indie chain like Brooklyn’s Nitehawk, go give them all your money! Long live the fun movie theater experience, which is totally possible! It just seems like few developers outside of major urban centers think it’s a worthwhile investment. Better to let the crumbling 1980s theaters of the suburbs molder away with minimal improvements when absolutely necessary.

In a story last year, CNET’s Joan Solsman quoted an expert who summed up the pre-pandemic moviegoing most of us were more familiar with: “For generations, going to the movies meant ‘sitting in a sh*tty seat eating bad food, just to be able to watch the movie you want,’ said Bob Cooney, a location-based entertainment industry expert. Like airlines that get away with a punishing customer experience because flying is the only way to get from one far-flung place to another, theaters enjoyed cushy, long-lasting theatrical exclusives that were sacrosanct before the pandemic.”

But I don’t think that experience has fundamentally changed. Even if you’re going to see a new release in a state-of-the art IMAX or Dolby theater, you’re still going to be expected to absorb as much ad content (and yes, that includes trailers!) as they feel they can get away with.

Still, I’m sure it’ll make you happy to hear AMC saw a 23% increase in revenue in 2023, growing to $4.81 billion from $3.91 billion the year before. “AMC reported strong results for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, once again exceeding Wall Street’s consensus expectations,” said AMC CEO Adam Aron, whose salary is just shy of $24 million. (Something tells me that guy’s never been forced to sit through Noovie.)

I’ll be curious to see what the tipping point is for big cinema chains — will they push their audiences into a boycott, or call off the advertising onslaught? If AMC and their competitors know what side their popcorn is buttered on, the next time a Timothée movie is out, they won’t make us wait an hour to see him.",https://edition.cnn.com

Paris CNN —

Were they real? Most people’s first reaction when viewing French President Emmanuel Macron’s moody black-and-white boxing photos this week was to question their authenticity. Had the bulging presidential bicep, veins popping, been swollen artificially?

Adam Plowright Courtesy Adam Plowright

On social media, some wondered if they were AI-generated or the result of creative photoshopping. But the images were from the president’s personal photographer. Asked about the cynics questioning her work, she dismissed them.

The social media meme factory cranked into action. Macron was mocked up as Popeye, the spinach-eating sailor superhero. He was compared to “Raging Bull” Jake LaMotta. Less flattering photos of his arms were located and placed side-by-side. “Your profile picture vs real life,” wrote one. Real boxing coaches critiqued his technique.

But the images invite much larger questions. Why has he done this? And why now?

The first part of the answer is that the 46-year-old has always been adept at making himself the center of the conversation. Since his first steps into politics in 2014, the self-styled “disruptor” knew how to harness the power of provocation. Politicians fear nothing more than irrelevance.

He’s always been sporty too. His soccer days are long gone and he finds little time for his beloved tennis, but he has boxed in the gym at the presidential palace since winning power in 2017, sometimes taking aides or bodyguards as sparring partners.

Getting the French moving is one of his current “national causes” ahead of the Paris Olympics this year. In January, he posted a video online, boxing gloves slung over his shoulder, urging French people to do 30 minutes of exercise a day.

But the photos said something larger. This was Macron pumped up, ready for a fight, with teeth gritted. Everywhere he looks at present, the centrist sees battles — most of them slipping away from him. The “Rocky” president might be in good shape physically, but he’s politically and diplomatically pinned in a corner.

His second term in office, won two years ago with minimal campaigning, was immediately embroiled in the country’s worst protests in decades and has drifted since. Despite all-offense against the anti-immigration party of far-right leader Marine Le Pen in recent months, the polls keep getting worse.

Le Pen’s party is on track to win elections for the European parliament in June again, with a possible 10 point winning margin. No serious commentator excludes the idea of her succeeding Macron in 2027 anymore. By some estimates, she and her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, are the second- and third-most popular politicians in the country.

The French economy is also on the slide, risking a blow-out of public finances. Macron convened senior ministers and allies for dinner this week, urging them over a seafood buffet to find ways to cut spending.

Bigger foes loom to the east and west. Many observers concluded the clichéd boxing photos were a message to the black-belt judoka in the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin, a master of the staged display of male virility, whether it be bare-chested horse riding or spearfishing.

Macron has plenty of previous form in this domain too, once posting a video of himself being lowered onto a nuclear submarine by helicopter.

Having spent months trying to avert war in Ukraine by sweet-talking Putin, Macron has transformed himself into Europe’s alpha defense hawk in recent months. Long gone are the days when he worried about “humiliating” the former KGB man and would chide Eastern European nations as “war-mongers”.

In late February, Macron refused to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, sending a shockwave through European capitals. At the same time, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a political punching bag at home whose perceived weakness infuriates Macron, was refusing to deliver long-range missiles to Kyiv.

Like leaders across the EU, Macron is also preparing for the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House. The French leader concluded that strength was the only language his bulky US counterpart understood during his first term in the White House. Handshakes between the two men were akin to wrestling matches, Macron once squeezing Trump’s knuckles so hard they turned white.

By temperament, the former investment banker is a risk-taker. By instinct, he likes being on the front foot. He might appear to be on the ropes, with problems mounting in Paris, Kyiv and Washington, but he wants us to know that he’ll keep on swinging.",https://edition.cnn.com
59,Trump’s hush money trial was set to begin Monday. Here’s what’s happening instead,"CNN —

Donald Trump’s first criminal trial was supposed to begin Monday.

Instead, his lawyers will get the chance to argue for a lengthy postponement and even a dismissal of the charges.

Judge Juan Merchan is holding a pre-trial hearing in New York on Monday to discuss the discovery issues that led to the delay of the trial on charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney related to hush money payments until at least the middle of next month.

Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business documents related to the repayment of Michael Cohen for hush-money payments made before the 2016 election to cover up an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.

If the trial starts in April, it would be the first of Trump’s four criminal trials to begin – and potentially the only one that would occur before the November election.

Here’s what to know:

What happened?

The trial was postponed and Monday’s hearing was ordered after more than 100,000 new documents were turned over by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, related to the 2018 prosecution of Trump’s former lawyer Cohen, who is a key witness in the case.

Trump’s lawyers say the new information is potentially exculpatory for the former president and they need at least 90 days to properly review the new material – a delay that fits with the former president’s overall efforts to delay all four criminal trials he’s facing until after the November election.

Merchan said the trial postponement would be 30 days from the date of his letter, March 15, meaning the earliest the trial could start is April 15.

The judge made clear that the hearing would only focus on the document production from the Southern District of New York, and not other issues such as the complaint from Trump’s lawyers that a new documentary about Daniels was intended to be released close to the start of trial to prejudice the jury pool.

What are the documents?

The documents in question relate to the 2018 federal investigation into Cohen that led to charges on campaign finance violations and tax evasion.

The bulk of the documents include records relied upon to obtain search warrants for Cohen’s devices and homes, including bank records. The US attorney’s office also turned over 30,000 pages related to documents seized from five iPhones and email accounts associated with Cohen.

In addition, prosecutors said the US attorney’s office turned over FBI interview notes from special counsel Robert Mueller’s interviews with Cohen, which the office only received in December as a result of Freedom of Information Act litigation.

In all, more than 200,000 pages of records this month were handed over.

Why were the documents turned over so late?

Trump’s attorneys and prosecutors are pointing fingers at one another over the reason the US attorney’s office did not turn over tens of thousands of documents until this month.

Trump’s team alleged that the district attorney was trying to hide exculpatory evidence ahead of the trial, and that the US attorney’s office only turned it over following a January subpoena from Trump’s attorneys.

But the district attorney says that Trump’s attorneys are to blame for the delay. Prosecutors argue that Trump’s attorneys raised no issues with the document production made in July 2023 until six months later with the January subpoena.

“The belated nature of the recent productions is entirely a result of defendant’s own inexplicable and strategic delay in identifying perceived deficiencies in the People’s disclosures and pursuing independent means to obtain that evidence,” prosecutors wrote in a filing.

What happens next?

The effort to dismiss the indictment is likely a long shot – Merchan has already rejected previous motions for dismissal.

But the judge could signal on Monday whether he thinks the delay he put in place is long enough to go through the new documents – and whether he might block any testimony.

Merchan, has already ruled that he would allow testimony from Cohen, rejecting a motion from Trump to prevent him from testifying because of credibility problems. And, he said Daniels could testify finding that she is part of the timeline.

A trial is expected to last six weeks, meaning Trump would be in the courtroom four days a week while it’s ongoing (the court will not meet on Wednesdays).",https://edition.cnn.com
60,Tammy Murphy is suspending New Jersey Senate campaign,"CNN —

New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy is suspending her campaign for Bob Menendez’s Senate seat, she announced Sunday.

“After many busy, invigorating, and yes, challenging months, I am suspending my Senate campaign today,” she said in a video posted on X. “I have been genuine and factual throughout, but it is clear to me that continuing in this race will involve waging a very divisive and negative campaign, which I am not willing to do.”

“And with Donald Trump on the ballot and so much at stake for our nation, I will not in good conscience waste resources tearing down a fellow Democrat,” she added.

Murphy’s decision comes just days before a judge was expected to rule on a lawsuit aimed at kneecapping local bigwigs’ influence over party primaries and the nominating process.

Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, who’s vying for the Senate seat, had asked the court for a preliminary injunction banishing the so-called party line – a ballot structure that allows county leaders to give preferential placement to their endorsed primary hopefuls – ahead of the June 4 primary.

But the judge in the case was concerned, and the defendants had argued, that the time frame was too tight to make such a change. With Murphy dropping out, however, the urgency to address the primary ballot design is gone – meaning “the line” could be in place for the coming primary election.

“We will continue our efforts to strengthen our democracy in New Jersey while we come together to stand up against the dangerous agenda pushed by Trump,” Kim said in a statement Sunday, suggesting the lawsuit would continue. The congressman praised Murphy as “a voice for progress and public service in our state,” adding, “I respect her decision to carry on that work as First Lady.”

Advocates of changing the party-line system raised questions about Murphy’s decision.

“This sudden change of heart on the part of Tammy Murphy, on the eve of the ruling of Judge (Zahid) Quraishi on the controversial New Jersey county line, seems more than suspicious,” Yael Niv, president of the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey, said in a text message.

“The Good Government Coalition of New Jersey – and the whole grassroots community that has been fighting the line for years – wonder if this announcement is not a last ditch effort to save the county line. This just feels very Jersey. It seems like the party machine that was propping up the First Lady has asked her to take one for the team,” Niv added.

Ezra Levin – the co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible, which has backed Kim – dismissed criticism that the congressman’s campaign is focused only on the ballot system. (Murphy said in her Sunday video, “Instead of talking about process and politics, my campaign has been about solutions for families and a vision for the next generation.”)

“Andy Kim’s campaign wasn’t focused on ‘process.’ It was focused on democracy. Democracy matters to voters. Democrats across the country should take note,” Levin said. “Andy Kim is now on track to become a unique voice in the Senate.”

Murphy, the wife of two-term Gov. Phil Murphy, entered the Democratic primary in November as a first-time candidate with previous associations with GOP politics. Her early endorsements in the primary, however, suggested she might get a plum spot on the ballot – and a potentially decisive advantage over Kim.

Under the party line system, party-backed candidates for a variety of offices appear in a single, prominent column on the ballot, whereas those who do not receive a place on “the line” are scattered across the ballot. Donald Trump’s election in 2016, and the resulting grassroots progressive activism, helped accelerate resistance to the party-line system, but it took off in a major way once the Murphy-Kim primary started brewing.

Menendez, who is facing bribery and obstruction of justice charges, announced Thursday that he would not run for reelection in the Democratic primary but again left open the possibility of an independent bid this summer. The senator has forcefully denied the charges against him and has said that he will prove his innocence while claiming that he is being persecuted by prosecutors.

61,"How Donald Trump, Joe Biden and grassroots liberals could upend Democratic politics in one of the country’s bluest states","Jersey City, New Jersey CNN —

The end of the line could be near for New Jersey’s almighty political machine.

A federal judge in Trenton is poised to rule as early as this week on a lawsuit aimed at kneecapping local bigwigs’ influence over party primaries and the nominating process. First lady Tammy Murphy’s suspension of her campaign on Sunday, however, has raised questions about the urgency of a decision ahead of the June 4 primary.

Democratic Senate candidate Andy Kim is asking the court for a preliminary injunction banishing the so-called party line – a ballot structure that allows county leaders to give preferential placement to their endorsed primary hopefuls. A ruling in the South Jersey congressman’s favor, though applicable only to the June primary, would – with the state’s off-year elections on the horizon – accelerate the unraveling of a system that has for decades allowed heavy-handed party bosses to dominate the makeup and character of New Jersey politics.

The fight for transparency and election fairness in the Garden State goes back more than a century. After some significant early wins for reformers, the balance of power shifted back to the machine over the course of the 20th century. By the time Donald Trump, the tabloid-star-turned-politician, came along in 2015, the system appeared to be hardened in its favor.

But Trump’s ascent to the presidency, even in a state that he lost by more than half a million votes in 2016, triggered a grassroots revolt that eventually put the “party line” in the crosshairs of good government advocates. The “pro-democracy” agenda embraced by President Joe Biden and national Democrats after the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol brought the issue further into the mainstream. Kim’s lawsuit, nearly a carbon copy of one originally filed three years ago, had attracted national attention because of his primary against Murphy. The wife of two-term Gov. Phil Murphy ended her campaign Sunday, citing her unwillingness to “waste resources tearing down a fellow Democrat.”

Kim, among others, is vying to replace Sen. Bob Menendez, the longtime Democratic incumbent now facing a thick and colorful assortment of corruption charges that could land him in prison for years. Menendez announced Thursday that he would not run for reelection in the Democratic primary but again left open the possibility of an independent bid this summer.

Murphy’s entrance in the primary in November, about two months after Kim, was greeted with a flood of endorsements, several of which either guaranteed or strongly suggested she would be given a plum spot on the primary ballot – and a potentially decisive advantage over Kim before the campaign had begun in earnest.

The tipping point

Murphy’s decision to seek the seat, and the speed with which local pooh-bahs lined up behind her, triggered what could be a generational realignment in a state historically dominated by powerful party bosses in the way that many Americans associate with a bygone era – recalling New York’s Tammany Hall of the mid-19th century.

Those structures largely came apart elsewhere over the past few decades, but New Jersey Democratic leaders have retained their unique influence thanks in large part to “the line,” a shorthand for the prized ballot real estate controlled by county party officials, many of whom are themselves unelected.

The practice places the names of party-backed candidates for a variety of offices in a single, prominent column. Those who do not receive a place on “the line” are scattered across the ballot, marooned in what is often referred to as “Ballot Siberia.” Reform advocates and progressive Democratic groups operating outside the good graces of entrenched leadership have long railed against the practice, calling it anti-democratic and tantamount to voter suppression.

For decades, though, “the line” existed without a serious challenge. The risks for dissenters was too high and, by its nature, the process successfully froze out critics who might want to run for office and seek change from within. The broader chilling effect largely zeroed out criticism even among minor players.

But the explosion of grassroots liberal engagement following Trump’s election – a shock to the system that ignited a wave of new interest that echoed the post-Watergate push for good government laws – emboldened “line” opponents.

Frustrated, anxious and angry, the Democratic grassroots across the country revolted at every level of government, mixing intense lobbying of federal lawmakers with a surge in outsider candidacies for down-ballot offices. Groups such as Indivisible, with its hyper-engaged local chapters – many stocked with middle-aged, upper-middle-class, first-time political activists – began to question everything from party strategy to the arcane institutional processes that had operated for so long with a minimum of oversight.

“The fight against the county line and the political machines really goes back to the election of Trump, when it picked up serious speed,” said Rutgers professor Julia Sass Rubin, who testified in Kim’s lawsuit and has conducted extensive research on the line’s outsize influence. “There were a number of grassroots organizations that formed, we saw this nationally, especially started by women.”

But Rubin said it was not until Murphy announced her Senate run, and immediately received broad backing from New Jersey Democratic leaders, that the issue exploded.

“The Tammy Murphy-Andy Kim race has put (the issue) on steroids. It has really amplified general public awareness, which was building. But it was building among the aware, kind of progressive grassroots,” Rubin said. “This brought it into the mainstream in a big way.”

Following Trump’s election, rank-and-file liberals in New Jersey – like many other largely Democratic states – rushed to enmesh themselves in local politics. But their ambitions were mostly thwarted. Though New Jersey Democrats picked up US House seats in the 2018 midterms, the state seemed immune to an explosion of political insurgencies, typified not only by the rise of “The Squad” but also the ascent of younger female and minority candidates who sought to wrest power from what they viewed as an indifferent, self-serving establishment.

“The (Democratic newcomers) thought they were on the right team here and thought because they were Democrats, they had the ability to stand up and say proudly that they’re the party for democracy, especially in light of Trump being president,” said longtime progressive activist Sue Altman, a Democratic candidate for the state’s 7th Congressional District. But that initial optimism was blunted when “they found out that at the local level or the city level or the county level or the state legislative level, that their own beloved Democrats were not practicing ‘little d’ democracy,” Altman said.

‘The line’ as ballast against the liberal grassroots

The complications facing would-be reformers in New Jersey were initially underscored by the state party’s lack of political turmoil. Though hardly a machine choice, wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive and Democratic National Committee finance chair Phil Murphy won the governor’s office in 2017.

Over the next few years, as political insurgents like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, across the river in New York, and Cori Bush in Missouri unseated longtime Democratic incumbents in races up and down the ballot, progressive groups largely bypassed New Jersey. The state’s expensive media market and the bureaucratic barriers facing outsider campaigns made it an unwise place to spend precious resources.

“It is extremely difficult to engage in any kind of competitive primaries in New Jersey because at the end of the day, the winners are likely going to be chosen by the establishment,” said Ezra Levin, the co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible.

Indivisible does not, like more confrontational groups including Justice Democrats, typically get involved in fraught primary fights. Their membership, Levin said, is engaged on multiple policy fronts, from health care to immigration, “but the very top issue that they care about is democracy itself – this feeling that it was under threat and this sense that the Democratic Party when Trump got elected was not equipped to take on that threat.”

Levin said that for Indivisible groups, the battle in New Jersey over “the line” has not been about a preference between Kim or Murphy, though the organization endorsed Kim.

“When I’m talking to our advocates, I will always say that the enemy isn’t MAGA, the enemy is cynicism and nihilism and fatalism,” Levin said. “Corrupt systems like the ‘county line’ in New Jersey (is) an enemy because that dissuades folks from actually getting involved. And if folks don’t get involved, then we’ll lose.”

As the Murphy-Kim race heated up, interest in ending – or, among party leaders, defending – “the line” has also increased in size and intensity. A 2021 lawsuit, brought by and supported by a coalition of progressive Democrats, including Altman and the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, has been wending its way through the court system for years.

But for Kim, there was no time to waste. He effectively took up the old litigation late last month, using the same lawyers, in a bid to redesign the ballots before the June 4 primary. His request of the court, simply put, is for a federal judge to order that New Jersey follow all other states and group together candidates for any given office.

On Monday, Kim testified in US District Judge Zahid Quraishi’s courtroom that he believed the current process “to be averse to the pursuit of democracy.”

“I’m not asking for any advantage for me,” Kim told the court. “All I’m asking for is for New Jersey to be in line with 49 other states in terms of pursuing an office block-style ballot that would allow us to have a fairer system here.”

Though Kim has also won some county lines in this primary, and appeared on them during his own past races, the third-term congressman argued that a fundamentally unjust institution compelled him to play ball.

“Despite my personal concerns about how this went,” Kim said, “I felt I had no choice but to participate in the system.”

The Murphy campaign, speaking before the candidate dropped out, took a dimmer view of Kim’s motivations.

“Unfortunately, Congressman Kim’s focus has been on personal attacks and process,” said Murphy spokesperson Alexandra Altman, who has previously dismissed the lawsuit as a “hypocritical stunt.”

Kim campaign spokesperson Katey Sabo disputed that characterization, calling the line’s potential undoing “a critical issue in protecting our democracy.”

The arguments against redrawing the ballots, at least in this case and the current discourse, are less high-minded, with the defendants in the suit – clerks from the 19 counties with county line ballots – contending that the changes sought by the plaintiff, Kim, would be too difficult to implement this late in the campaign-election calendar. (Ballots are printed and mailed out well before the June 4 primary date.)

A ruling is expected in the coming days or weeks. Tammy Murphy, who is not involved in the case, had said she would follow the rules, regardless of the outcome. Altman, her spokesperson, told CNN that Kim’s strategy “does not help the real New Jerseyans struggling to make ends meet or protect their reproductive rights from being stripped away.”

Days of chaos

No matter how the judge decides in Kim’s last-ditch bid, “the line” appears to be on borrowed time.

Ahead of the hearing last week, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin announced in a letter to the court that he would not defend the “challenged statutes,” calling them “unconstitutional.” He will also drop out of the 2021 case, which remains in the judicial pipeline, after initially defending “the line.”

The governor, under whom Platkin served as general counsel before being appointed to his current post, publicly disagreed with his longtime political ally, saying a defense of the system “would have been appropriate and consistent with the actions” of Platkin’s predecessors.

“Outside the context of any campaign, Governor Murphy has consistently and accurately noted that the bracketing of candidates is permitted by duly enacted laws that have been on the books for decades,” Murphy spokesman Mahen Gunaratna told CNN. “It is well-established that Attorneys General have a general obligation to defend the constitutionality of statutes, regardless of their own personal views.”

That dust-up followed a weekend in which Kim had secured the backing of Democrats in Morris and Atlantic counties – where the process isn’t as tightly controlled by party leadership. In Camden County, where the local boss keeps a tighter grip, video of another Senate candidate, progressive Patricia Campos-Medina, being blocked from entering the county Democratic convention went viral.

Around the time Platkin’s memo went out, the Hoboken Democrats – who operate under the powerful Hudson County Democratic Organization, whose leader backed Tammy Murphy immediately upon her entering the race – announced that their own process had yielded a landslide victory for Kim. Moments later, Hoboken Democratic Committee Chair Rachel Hodes announced her resignation, alleging harassment by Murphy allies and a “gross rejection of democracy” by the county group.

“Since we announced this (endorsement) meeting, I began receiving calls and emails denigrating and diminishing the integrity of our process,” Hodes wrote. “Multiple senior advisors on the Tammy Murphy campaign called me to coerce me into changing our process, essentially calling it a sham.”

Both sides have acknowledged that a key sticking point was the Hoboken Democrats’ decision to solicit written statements from the candidates rather than inviting them to deliver their message in person. (Candidates were allowed to make more direct appeals to Hoboken committee voters.)

The train kept rolling on Monday morning when, shortly before the federal court hearing began, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who is running to succeed Phil Murphy as governor in 2025, switched sides in the Senate primary and backed Kim.

“It’s no secret I’ve been disappointed with the (Tammy Murphy) campaign and how it has been conducted,” Fulop said in a statement, which also suggested the first lady consider bowing out of the race. “I’ve expressed that over the last two months repeatedly both privately and publicly, and at this point, it’s clear to me that I was wrong with my early support and endorsement of Tammy Murphy for Senate.”

The growing backlash among ambitious officials underscored the rapidly changing tides of public opinion – and awareness. On Wednesday, in another sign of concern among brass from both parties (New Jersey Republicans also employ “the line” in their primaries), state Senate and Assembly leaders announced they would begin “a public process on ballot design in New Jersey, including a thorough and thoughtful review of other states, as well as a process that involves input from the public.”

But their statement also echoed other supporters of “the line,” insisting that the legislature – and not the courts – keep “the authority to determine the law regarding ballot design and the appropriate discretion used by county clerks.”

“We are prepared to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure public trust in a transparent and democratic process in New Jersey,” the leadership quartet said.

For many Democrats in the Garden State, however, their words landed with a thud. How the court views the pledge, and whether it is taken into consideration, remains to be seen.

62,House Democrats want Speaker Johnson to outline path on Ukraine aid before agreeing to save his job,"CNN —

House Democrats may save Mike Johnson’s speakership – but he first must outline a pathway to approving aid to Ukraine, multiple Democratic sources told CNN.

If Johnson were to announce he would take up the Senate’s $95 billion aid package, Democrats would vote in droves to keep him in the position, sources said.

Yet Johnson has already signaled an openness to a separate bipartisan plan emerging in the House, and he’d already told GOP lawmakers that he may schedule floor time on that plan when lawmakers return from their Easter recess.

But that bipartisan plan has generated little Democratic enthusiasm, in large part because of its new border security restrictions, including reinstating the so-called “Remain in Mexico” policy. Plus, Johnson has signaled a willingness to turn the Ukraine aid into a loan for the country, an idea floated by former President Donald Trump that has prompted Democratic skepticism.

If Johnson tries to move on the House plan, Democrats may opt to save him but in smaller numbers, one Democratic source said.

While the exact timing remains unclear, the first procedural vote to oust Johnson is expected to take the form of a “motion to table” – or kill – fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resolution to vacate the speakership. Democrats are weighing whether to kill the resolution on the first procedural vote, but say they need to hear the speaker publicly outline his intentions on Ukraine aid.

“If he does the responsible thing, which is allowing members of Congress to vote on a bill that will pass and that is in our national security interests, and subsequent to that a non-serious actor that doesn’t want to govern brings a motion to vacate, yes I would motion to table in that circumstance,” Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, told CNN.

In a meeting Friday before Greene announced her intention to force a vote seeking Johnson’s ouster, the speaker already was telling Republicans he was ready to move on an aid package for Ukraine when they return. But it’s unclear what form that package will take.

“He said that’s going to come to the floor when we come back,” Rep. Greg Pence, an Indiana Republican, told CNN after meeting with Johnson on Friday morning. “And I think that’s good.”

Republicans warn Greene’s move could cost them the House

Several House Republicans have also warned that Greene’s move to oust Johnson could cost them the House in November, though some hardliners are weighing whether they would ultimately vote to remove him.

Greene, for her part, indicated Sunday that she may not even force a vote this Congress.

“I filed this motion to vacate but I haven’t called it,” she said on Fox News. “(I’m) giving our conference notice saying that we have got to find a new speaker. This may take weeks, it may take months, it may not even happen until next Congress. But Speaker Johnson cannot remain as Speaker of the House.”

Greene did not call up her resolution before the House left for a two-week recess on Friday, which means the two-legislative-day clock to force a vote has not yet started. It is ultimately up to Greene when and whether she forces a vote.

Pence said the chaos in the House is “turning people off” politics.

“You know, when I go home, people are telling me they’re not following what’s going on here anymore because they are tired of it. And when I mentioned that on the floor this week, talking to my peers, they’re hearing the same thing,” he said. “These games, not working together, it’s turning people off. And we want people to be engaged in politics and we’re working the wrong way.”

Pressed on whether it could cost them the majority, Pence replied, “Oh, it surely could. It’s possible, right? It’s not helpful.”

House Homeland Security Chair Mark Green, meanwhile, told CNN, “I’m disappointed. … I think it’s a distraction. We need to just – unfortunately this bill passed, and we’ve got a lot of other stuff now to do, some articles to walk over… we don’t need anything that’s going to disrupt that.”

He said he hoped Greene will ultimately decide not to call up her resolution for a vote. “I don’t think we’ll let that happen this time. I mean, we’ll see how it goes, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.”

But Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the House Republican campaign arm, downplayed the damage another speaker’s fight could cause in an election year. “I just don’t think people out there in the real world, outside of this bubble we’re standing in right now, care as much about who the speaker of the House is as they do about how expensive it is to buy the things they need for their family,” he said. “We are going to grow this House majority despite things that go on the House floor day to day.”

He argued that “Speaker Johnson is going to remain speaker” despite the threat to oust him. “The House has to have a speaker to function. So, we need a speaker and I think Speaker Johnson has been an outstanding speaker and I stand behind him. I think we’ll get through this,” he added.

Some hardliners are weighing whether they will vote to oust Johnson once it is brought up. “I’m open to that conversation,” said Rep. Eli Crane, one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall.

Rep. Chip Roy on Sunday appeared reluctant to support Greene’s motion to vacate. But Roy did say “Mike was wrong” for not allotting members a full 72 hours to consider the funding package.

“I opposed the use of the motion to vacate against Kevin McCarthy, very openly and very loudly against my right-flank colleagues and everybody across the entire body,” the Texas Republican told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”

But Roy declined to directly say whether he would support his former House Freedom Caucus colleague’s motion, instead slamming the media for focusing on “inside-the-Beltway palace drama.”

Rep. Ralph Norman indicated that he was still considering it as well. “We’ll see what happens. Look, I take this minute by minute,” he said. Pressed on whether he was comfortable overthrowing their leadership at this point, Norman replied, “I’m not saying that. Let’s see how we come out on this bill. Let’s see what he does, and we’ll go from there.”

He added, “Anything’s possible.”

McCarthy on Sunday urged Johnson to “not be fearful” of a potential vote to oust him from the speakership. “I do not think they could do it again,” McCarthy said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

“I don’t think the Democrats will go along with it too,” McCarthy added. “Focus on the country. Focus on the job you’re supposed to do, and actually do it fearlessly. Just move forward.”

63,Former RNC chair McDaniel calls January 6 Capitol attack ‘unacceptable’ after years of deflection,"CNN —

Former Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Sunday called the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol “unacceptable” after years of deflecting on the issue.

McDaniel, who is joining NBC News as a political analyst after exiting the RNC earlier this month, told the outlet that the Capitol riot “doesn’t represent our country. It certainly does not represent my party.”

“We should not be attacking the Capitol; we should not be having violence,” she added. Asked why she didn’t offer such condemnation as RNC chairwoman, McDaniel responded, “When you’re the RNC chair, you kind of take one for the whole team. Right now, I get to be a little bit more myself.”

McDaniel’s RNC exit comes amid a period of rising tensions between Donald Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, and the RNC. Trump and his team had been disappointed with the RNC’s finances, with the committee experiencing one of its most anemic years of fundraising in the last decade.

The former president also believed that the RNC under McDaniel’s leadership should have done more to fight for his candidacy in the 2020 election, including retaining better lawyers to push the former president’s false claims of rampant voter fraud.

Trump, McDaniel said Sunday, “absolutely wanted me to move aside and wanted Michael Whatley and Lara Trump to come in.”

McDaniel said that while her role required her to remain neutral regarding GOP candidates, tensions rose with the Trump campaign when the former president decided to forgo this cycle’s primary debates.

“We had debates, and there was tension and a little friction that started during that process. It was well played out in the media,” McDaniel said. “And I knew at that point, when I was doing that role, and we were going to have debates, that when the nominee came forward, and it was likely to be President Trump, that they were going to switch and that’s his right as nominee.”

News of McDaniel’s hiring at NBC has drawn sharp backlash. She has a long history of assailing the news media as “fake” and her promotion of false claims around the 2020 elections.

As RNC chair, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel told the officials, regarding the certification: “Do not sign it. … We will get you attorneys.”

The Michigan Department of State’s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had “no merit.” The state’s “elections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,” it said in a detailed fact check posted online.

McDaniel acknowledged Sunday that Biden won the 2020 election “fair and square” even as she voiced concern over “issues” with the vote. “I believe that both can be true,” she said.

Asked about the criticism of her RNC tenure, and the blame some have placed on her for a slate of Republican losses, McDaniel said, “I push back on that very hard.”

“Under my time as chair, we’ve had more women in Congress ever than in the history of our party … we’ve had more minority growth in our party, and that didn’t just happen.”

64,"Pandas come in different shades, and scientists now understand why","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

With its striking coloration, the giant panda is an instantly recognizable species.

A handful of giant pandas that aren’t black-and-white, however, do exist. These majestic creatures with brown-and-white fur inhabit a single mountain range in China. And now, scientists may have unraveled the mystery of the extremely rare pandas’ unusual coats, according to new research.

The work, which involved studying the genetics of multiple pandas in the wild and in captivity, has suggested that pandas with brown-and-white coats are the result of natural variation, rather than a sign of inbreeding in a dwindling population.

The first brown panda known to science was a female named Dandan. A local ranger found the ailing bear in Foping County in Shaanxi province’s Qinling Mountains in March 1985. The panda was held in captivity until her death in 2000.

Since Dandan’s discovery decades ago, there have been 11 reported sightings documented through official news sources or personal accounts shared with the authors of this latest study that appeared in the journal PNAS on March 4.

“The recurring instances of brown pandas imply that this trait may be inheritable. However, to date, the genetic basis underlying the brown-and-white coat color remains unclear,” the authors wrote.

Gaining a better understanding of the distinctive coloration could help inform efforts to breed brown-and-white pandas in captivity, said senior author Dr. Fuwen Wei, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Zoology in Beijing. The status of the giant panda as a species is vulnerable, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

A panda family tree

To understand what lies behind the trait, the researchers studied Qizai, a male brown panda rescued as a cub in 2009 from Foping National Nature Reserve in Hanzhong. He is currently the only brown panda in captivity.

When compared under a microscope with hair samples from three black-and-white pandas, Qizai’s brownish fur had fewer and smaller melanosomes, tiny structures found in cells that are responsible for skin and hair pigment in mammals. What’s more, the melanosomes were more likely to be irregularly shaped, the study team found.

The researchers then gathered genetic information about Qizai and pieced together his family tree. Fresh scat, or bear poop, gathered at the nature reserve revealed the identity of his wild mother, a black-and-white female panda that wears a tracking collar and is known as Niuniu.

The researchers also identified Qizai’s son, a black-and-white panda born in captivity in 2020. (The study team later identified Qizai’s father, Xiyue, a wild but tracked black-and-white panda, by studying the genetics of a wider population of pandas.)

The scientists studied the genetic information from Qizai’s family members and compared it with the genetic information from 12 black-and-white pandas from the Qinling Mountains and 17 black-and-white pandas from other regions in China using information taken from scat and blood samples.

While none of Qizai’s immediate family members had brown fur, the researchers were able to show that his parents and son all had one copy of the recessive trait on a gene known as Bace2, while Qizai had two copies.

An individual’s genes can carry recessive traits, such as blue eyes or red hair in humans, without appearing as a physical characteristic. Each parent must possess a copy of the genetic variant and pass it on in order for the trait to appear in the offspring, as is the case with Qizai.

Genetic analysis solves an enigma

Thanks to an analysis of a tissue sample stored for more than two decades in ethanol, the scientists also were able to sequence the genome of Dandan, the first known brown panda. Dandan had the same recessive trait, the researchers found.

The scientists then conducted a wider analysis of 192 black-and-white giant pandas to verify the responsible gene as Bace2. The mutation causing the brown coats was only present in two pandas hailing from the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, not Sichuan province, where the majority of China’s giant pandas live.

To confirm the findings, the scientists used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool to delete the genetic sequence they had identified as causing the mutation in the Bace2 gene in 78 lab mice. The change reduced the number and size of melanosomes in the mice.

“The coat color of knockout mice is light brown,” said Wei, who is also president at Jiangxi Agricultural University in Nanchang in China’s Jiangxi province.

“It proves that this deletion has the potential to alter the coat color of a mouse, as the pigmentation pathway is relatively conserved (shared) among mammals. Therefore, it is very likely that this mutation influences the coat color of a brown panda.”

Natural variation vs. inbreeding

It’s not clear what caused the genetic mutation. Wei said it must be linked to the specific environment of the Qinling Mountains, which has a different climate than Sichuan. The genetic mutation did not appear to be a result of inbreeding, as once suspected, he said.

“It is more likely to be a result of natural variation rather than inbreeding. Our kinship analysis indicates that Qizai’s parents are not closely related,” Wei added.

Tiejun Wang, an associate professor in the department of natural resources at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, said it was good news that the unique coloration did not appear to be the result of inbreeding. Wang, who has studied brown pandas, was not involved in the study.

“For those who are concerned about this species, this is a positive development,” said Wang, who said he worked as a field ranger in the mountains for 10 years.

Wang said he applauded the team “for their tremendous efforts in trying to shed light on this scientific question.”",https://edition.cnn.com
65,Ditch your air fryer and replace it with a countertop oven,"Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.

CNN —

My love affair with small appliances started at an early age.

The Easy-Bake Oven was my first glimpse of what magic could come from a miniature box, leading to a few experiments with microwave cooking — think nachos and Rice Krispie Treat bowls—during my latchkey kid years. And the minute I got my own off-campus apartment in college, I invested in my very own toaster oven.

Twenty-something years later, toaster oven technology has moved far beyond the analog dial and hot coils of my first model. But my small oven love remains strong, and it’s the most-used appliance in my daily life.

The word “oven” is crucial in its name because it does everything my full-size conventional oven can do and more. In fact, it’s not just a toaster oven; it’s a countertop oven.

If I had to choose to keep only one of my kitchen toys — the high-speed blender, the stand mixer, the compressor ice-cream maker, the multicooker — the countertop oven would likely come out on top. (OK, I admit it would be difficult to give up the stand mixer.) That’s how deep my commitment to my countertop oven reaches. Here’s why.

The toaster oven is the original multitasker

Instead of having multiple appliances crowding my countertop, the countertop oven does the work of many. It toasts bread and bagels, sure, but it also has the capability to do convection baking, air frying, dehydrating and dough proofing.

Its broiler is spacious enough and functions so much more effectively than my oven’s broiler that I don’t even risk throwing out my back to shove sheet pans into the drawer underneath the full-size oven. (Who designed these bottom broiler drawers, anyway?)

My countertop oven is also my secret weapon in the fight for better leftovers. When I create a monthly meal plan, I’m always planning to reheat half of what I’m cooking, so this is a crucial function. And because most dishes taste better when they’re not zapped in a microwave, I let my countertop oven restore my meals to their original crispy, bubbly texture. No more soggy cutlets or mushy pasta casseroles in this house!

A countertop oven is a quick fix

Yes, I understand that a countertop oven will never heat food as quickly as the one-minute express cook button on a microwave can. But I’ll argue that the taste trade-offs are worth it, and that you’ll still be heating food and cooking more quickly than you would in a large conventional oven.

My countertop oven preheats to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) in five minutes (I’ve timed it), whereas my full-size oven takes 15 minutes to reach the same temperature. That’s a big difference — I can be done eating my leftover-but-perfectly-heated pizza in those 10 minutes!

Moreover, the convection and air-fry functions on my countertop oven cook food more quickly and efficiently than conventional heat, since the convection method circulates hot air around the food for a more even heat distribution. I can shave at least five minutes off my baking and roasting times every time I make meals in my countertop oven.

When the decades-old range in our kitchen finally went to the big scrap pile in the sky a few years ago, I refused to replace it with a high-end model. My top-of-the-line countertop oven cost half as much as the range we purchased, and I use it twice as often.

It’s a summer savior

I’ll never forget the process of testing my first cookbook, “Classic Snacks Made from Scratch,” during a sweltering New Jersey summer. It was July, and I was working on various recipes for homemade crackers, which meant keeping my oven on for hours — in a house without central air-conditioning.

In between batches, I laid on my kitchen floor, sweating and crying, wondering why I was voluntarily putting myself through such torture.

I still don’t have central air, but thankfully, I’m not regularly tasked with developing and testing multiple baked goods every day of the week. For everyday summer baking and roasting, however, I’ll use my countertop oven, which gives off much less heat than my full-size oven and cools down much more quickly once its cooking cycle is finished.

If I want to bake some goodies that require my larger baking sheets or multiple sheet pans, I’ll simply bake on my grill.

What to look for in a countertop oven

So, I’ve convinced you to ditch all your other appliances and replace them with a countertop oven. Great! But before you rush out to buy one, think about what oven best suits your cooking habits.

Choose a model that can fit your everyday cookware and bakeware. My countertop oven is deep and wide enough to fit a standard 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) casserole dish or sheet pan or a 10-inch (25-centimeter) round baking pan or cast-iron skillet. This means I can cook meals for up to six or eight people in one little appliance.

Size does matter. Yes, choosing a smaller oven can be tempting when it comes to keeping your kitchen looking open and tidy. For the most versatility, however, I’d recommend going with the largest model that can comfortably fit the space you’re planning to use it in. Your foods need the air circulating around them in the oven to cook most efficiently, so having a space that’s too small to allow that won’t be doing you any favors.

Consider what extra functions you’ll need. As I noted earlier, my countertop oven comes with a lot of bells and whistles — including a few functions I don’t even bother using. I’ve never tried the slow cook function, for instance, even though it’s there. Some models come with wi-fi functionality so you can control them via an app. Decide if these things are worth the money to you.

66,‘Dirty Dozen’ 2024 list of foods with most pesticides,"Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.

CNN —

Approximately 95% of nonorganic strawberries, leafy greens such as spinach and kale, collard and mustard greens, grapes, peaches and pears tested by the United States government contained detectable levels of pesticides, according to the 2024 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce.

Nectarines, apples, bell and hot peppers, cherries, blueberries and green beans rounded out the list of the 12 most contaminated samples of produce. It’s dubbed the “Dirty Dozen” by the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an environmental and health advocacy organization that has produced the annual report since 2004.

Pesticides have been linked in studies to preterm births, congenital malformations such as neural tube defects, spontaneous abortions and an increase in genetic damage in humans. Exposure to pesticides has also been associated with lower sperm concentrations, heart disease, cancer and other disorders.

Farmworkers who use or are exposed to pesticides are at highest risk, according to studies. A 2022 meta-analysis found workers exposed to pesticides were nearly five times as likely to have DNA damage while a February study found children exposed at an early age showed poorer neurodevelopment from infancy to adolescence.

It’s not all bad news. Avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, onions and papayas led the “Clean Fifteen” list of conventionally grown produce with the least amount of trace pesticides — nearly 65% of the fruits and veggies in that grouping had no detectable pesticide residues, according to the report released Wednesday.

Rounding out the “Clean Fifteen” were frozen sweet peas, asparagus, honeydew melons, kiwis, cabbage, watermelons, mushrooms, mangoes, sweet potatoes and carrots.

Washed, peeled and scrubbed

Each year, a rotating list of domestic and imported produce is tested by US Department of Agriculture and US Food and Drug Administration. Staffers at the USDA Pesticide Data Program wash, peel and scrub fruits and vegetables as consumers would, while workers at the FDA only brush dirt off the produce. Then the fruits and vegetables are tested for more than 250 different pesticides and the results are posted online.

For 2024, EWG researchers examined testing data on 47,510 samples of 46 nonorganic fruits and vegetables, with the majority of testing from the USDA. An analysis of that data found traces of 254 pesticides in all fruits and vegetables analyzed, with 209 of those chemicals on produce in the “Dirty Dozen” list.

“We find that what ends up on one list versus the other reflects how those fruits and vegetables are grown,” said Alexis Temkin, EWG’s senior toxicologist. “Avocados, for example, aren’t pesticide intensive, while strawberries grow very close to the ground and have a lot of pests.”

Report is unfair to farmers, critics say

About 70% of nonorganic produce tested by the USDA and FDA have pesticide levels within the legal limits allowed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to the EWG report. That fact makes the report misleading, said Carl Winter, emeritus professor of cooperative extension at the University of California, Davis.

“The dose makes the poison, not its presence or its absence, and that dose determines the potential for harm. In many cases you’d have to be exposed to a million times more than what we’re exposed to before you’d even see any effects,” said Winter, speaking on behalf of the Alliance on Food and Farming, which represents organic and conventional farmers.

However, “legal levels do not mean safe levels,” Temkin said in response. She pointed to times when regulators allowed potentially dangerous chemicals, such as the pesticide DCPA, to remain on the market long after scientific research had raised concerns. The herbicide was linked to thyroid concerns for years before the EPA told the public the chemical posed “significant risks to human health” in 2023.

Another example: chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to brain damage in children and fetuses. The American Academy of Pediatrics joined EWG in 2017 protesting the EPA’s continued approval of the chemical.

In addition, pesticides banned by the government continue to show up on crops sold in the US, according to the EWG report.

“Green beans for example, continue to show traces of acephate, a toxic pesticide the EPA banned for use on green beans more than 10 years ago,” Temkin said. “A lot of pesticides found on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ have also been banned in the European Union because of their harmful effects on human health.”

Another concern from critics is that the “Dirty Dozen” list is insulting to multigenerational farmers who struggle to grow food for the nation and feed those same products to their own children, said Steve Clement, CEO of Pacific Northwest Tree Fruit

“When this report comes out it’s like getting stabbed a little bit because we’re working so hard to put out a nice healthy product, and the implication of the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list is that it is unhealthy,” Clement said. “It’s like doing something kind for somebody and then having them turn around and call you some sort of monster.”

The report may scare people away from eating the fruits and vegetables they need, said Neil Nagata, whose family has grown organic and conventional strawberries in Oceanside, California, for decades.

“Every time the report comes out, or there’s a scare on imported strawberries, we see our sales drop off,” Nagata said. “It’s not as if we’re doing something that is wrong or incorrect, we’re actually producing very healthy, safe food. In fact, we actually live in the strawberry field and my father is 100 and my mom is 97, and they still eat strawberries.”

Some farmers feel the term ""Dirty Dozen"" is insulting, according to the Alliance on Food and Farming. kcline/iStockphoto/Getty Images

It is important that people eat lots of fruits and vegetables, even conventionally grown, said EWG’s Temkin.

“We always emphasize that,” she said. “We want to enable consumers who wish to avoid as many pesticides as possible by opting for organic versions of the ‘Dirty Dozen,’ where pesticide levels will be lower, and then, if they wish, choose less expensive conventionally grown produce from the ‘Clean Fifteen.’”

Organic produce is not more nutritious, but studies have found that levels of pesticides in the urine of adults and children can drop up to 95% after a switch to an organic diet.

Fungicide levels were high

For the first time, EWG analysts looked at reported levels of fungicides, one form of pesticide used to kill fungal diseases such as powdery mildew.

“Four out of five of the most frequently found pesticides on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list were fungicides, and they were also found in particularly high concentrations,” Temkin said.

Two fungicides — fludioxonil and pyrimethanil — had the highest concentration on the “Dirty Dozen” list of any other pesticide, according to the report. Fludioxonil was found on 90% of peaches and nearly 30% of all “Dirty Dozen” samples, according to the report. Pyrimethanil was found on 65% of pear, 30% of apple, 27% of grape, 26% of strawberry and 24% of nectarine samples.

“Fungicides are often applied after harvest to keep produce mold-free on its way to market. That’s likely why the concentrations were so high on some samples – higher than other pesticides applied earlier in the growing season,” Temkin said. “The application of the fungicide is also closer to the time the produce is put on store shelves and consumers are eating them.”

Fludioxonil creates a waxy coating on the fruit or vegetable that studies find is difficult to wash away. While the EPA finds fludioxonil safe at regulated levels, some studies have raised concerns that it might disrupt hormone and neurological systems. Exposing breast cancer cells to fludioxonil in a petri dish found the fungicide increased cell production by 1.5%.

Pyrimethanil was classified as a “possible human carcinogen” by the EPA in 2004, but the agency determined in 2015 the chemical was “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans” at low doses. Studies have shown it to be toxic to tree frogs and aquatic life, and it may disrupt thyroid levels in pregnant women living in agricultural areas. In lab tests, pyrimethanil and fludioxonil were show to impact androgen activity — hormones that contribute to growth and reproduction in both men and women.

Ways to reduce pesticides in your food

Cleaning fruits and vegetables before eating does reduce pesticide levels, but “no washing method is 100% effective for removing all pesticide residues,” according to the National Pesticide Information Center.

Starting with clean hands, wash and rub produce under running water instead of soaking to remove the most pesticide, the center recommends on its website.

Don’t use soap, detergent or a commercial soak or scrub, however, as they have not been proven to be any more effective, according to the FDA. Dry the produce with a clean cloth or paper towel to further reduce bacteria that may be present.",https://edition.cnn.com
67,Kermitops: Newly identified fossil named for Kermit the Frog could help solve evolutionary puzzle,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Paleontologists with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History have discovered a previously unknown prehistoric species — a 270 million-year-old amphibian with wide eyes and a cartoonish grin — and its name is a nod to an iconic froggy celebrity.

Kermit the Frog meet Kermitops gratus, the most recent ancient amphibian to be identified after examination of a tiny fossilized skull that once sat unstudied in the Smithsonian fossil collection for 40 years, according to a paper published Thursday in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.

Predating the dinosaurs, Kermitops is believed to have roamed the lower Clear Fork Formation of Texas during the Early Permian Epoch 298.9 million to 272.3 million years ago. The skull of the ancient amphibian, measuring just over an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) long, features big oval eye sockets and — due to its slightly crushed state — a lopsided smile that researchers said reminded them of the Muppet icon.

The researchers believe the small opening at the tip of the critter's snout, the internarial fontanelle, held a mucus gland that would aid in catching insects. The palpebral ossicles were small boney shingles embedded within the eyelid to protect the eye. Brittany M. Hance/Smithsonian/CNN

The discovery of the new amphibian species could provide some answers to how frogs and salamanders evolved to get their special characteristics today, the authors wrote in the paper.

“One thing that Kermitops really shows is that the origins of modern amphibians are a little more complex than some of the research has led on,” said study coauthor Arjan Mann, a postdoctoral paleontologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.

“And that really means that people need to keep studying these things because just looking at museum collections, like this fossil, has the potential to change our ideas of evolutionary hypotheses of living lineages.”

Kermitops, not a frog

The fossil was first uncovered in 1984 by the late Nicholas Hotton III, a museum paleontologist who had excavated fossils from the Red Beds in Texas, an area known to be rich in Permian-age remains.

Researchers unearthed a large cache at the site, including the remains of ancient reptiles, amphibians and synapsids, the precursors to mammals. The resulting collection included so many finds, paleontologists could not study a number of the specimens, including the newly named Kermitops. That changed in 2021, when the skull caught the eye of Mann, a postdoctoral fellow at the time, who was sifting through the Texas collection to see whether any notable specimens had been overlooked.

Authors of the new paper, Calvin So (left) and Arjan Mann (right), named the prehistoric amphibian after Kermit the Frog.

Loreto/Courtesy National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian

“Not only was (the skull) well-prepared by somebody, but it had features that distinguished it from anything else in the group that I’d ever seen,” Mann said. In early 2023, Calvin So, lead author of the new paper and a doctoral student at George Washington University, began to study the skull for a doctoral paper.

Kermitops is not classified as a frog because the prehistoric amphibian does not share all the same traits and anatomy found in modern frogs, So said. But the researchers determined the specimen is from the group temnospondyls, which are believed to be the most common ancestor of all lissamphibians — a category that includes frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Mann added.

The researchers noted several features that the ancient amphibian shares with its modern-day relatives, including a similar location for the eardrum at the back of the skull, a small opening between the nostrils that produces a sticky mucus to help frogs catch their prey, and even evidence of bicuspid, pedicellate teeth that are unique to amphibians and are found in most modern amphibian species.

Features of the ancient amphibian

The presence of teeth and other modern features of this prehistoric species can help researchers to better understand the evolutionary transition amphibians went through to get their unique features, such as teeth, today. A June 2021 study found that some species of frogs have lost and again evolved teeth several times throughout their lineages.

“This work is significant because it provides yet one more distinct early distant relative of our modern amphibians,” said David Blackburn, a coauthor of that 2021 study and a curator of amphibians and reptiles at the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida, via email.

“The last 20 to 30 years has seen many new species discovered and described of these distant relatives, and each discovery tends to reshape our knowledge of the evolutionary tree,” Blackburn added.

But Kermitops had many features distinct from its modern relatives. The critter’s robust skull had additional bones and elements that have likely disappeared with evolution, and its elongated snout paired with a short region of the skull behind the eyes was unique to the species, most likely serving to aid in catching insects.

The fossil’s features, a mix of modern and prehistoric traits, reinforces previous suggestions that amphibians’ evolution was complex, said Marc Jones, a curator of fossil reptiles at the Natural History Museum London.

“It further adds to the diversity of Early Permian animals that are likely the evolutionary cousins of modern amphibians. It highlights the need for more fossils from the Late Permian,” Jones said via email, adding he appreciated the amphibian’s name. “It’s not a frog but then technically neither is Kermit. He has five fingers and a lizard frill.”

The preservation of small fossils

The early fossil record for lissamphibians is considered to be fragmentary, according to a news release from the Smithsonian Institution, and is largely due to the creatures’ small size and delicate bone composition, which make the fossils difficult to preserve and find later, So said.

“What we see today is but a small percentage of all the things that were living in Earth’s history,” So added. “And one of the conditions that significantly improves fossil preservation is their size, because if it’s larger, it’s going to be more resistant to some of the erosional forces that we experience such as wind erosion and water erosion.”

What’s more, while prehistoric species are typically thought to be large, Kermitops could help to fill in the gap of amphibian evolution, explaining how some of today’s critters got their small size.

The skull of Kermitops is of similar size to the skull of another well-known Early Permian amphibian, Gerobatrachus, which had a head about an inch in length (2.5 centimeters). But many frogs today have bodies shorter than that length, Blackburn said.

“You might wonder, ‘Were there really no very tiny vertebrates in the past, similar in size to miniature species today?’ My bet is that yes, they existed, but our ability to find them in the fossil record is very difficult,” Blackburn added.

So said they hoped the species’ name would draw attention to the notable discoveries that paleontologists make through studying museum collections of prehistoric fossils — including those less imposing than dinosaurs.

“We wanted to name it Kermitops because we wanted to bring attention to this unique fossil that’s really small, that most people would not notice if you were to put it next to a Tyrannosaurus in the gallery,” So said.",https://edition.cnn.com
68,Mount Toba: One of the largest eruptions in Earth’s history could have wiped out humans,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

About 74,000 years ago, Sumatra’s Mount Toba experienced a super-eruption, one of the largest in Earth’s history, potentially kicking off a massive disruption in the world’s climate.

Some scientists have suspected a volcanic winter resulting from the eruption was a big enough shift to wipe out most early humans due to genetic evidence suggesting a steep drop in the human population. But now a cutting-edge study on an archaeological site in northwest Ethiopia once occupied by early modern humans has added to a growing body of evidence that suggests the event might not have been so apocalyptic.

Instead, the new research found humans in that location, known as Shinfa-Metema 1, adapted to the arid conditions brought on by the volcanic eruption in a way that may have facilitated humanity’s pivotal migration out of Africa to the rest of the world.

Microscopic fragments of volcanic glass found alongside stone tools and animal remains in the same layer of sediment at the Shinfa-Metema 1 site, near Ethiopia’s Shinfa River, show humans were occupying the site before and after the volcano erupted more than 4,000 miles away.

“These fragments are less than the diameter of a human hair. Even as tiny as (that) they are still big enough to analyze the chemistry and the trace elements,” said John Kappelman, a professor of anthropology and geological science at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of the study, which published Wednesday in the journal Nature.

By piecing together clues from the fossils and artifacts found at the site, along with geological and molecular analysis, the team began to understand how the humans living there forged ahead despite the likely climate shift that the volcanic cataclysm triggered.

Catching fish

To understand the climate around the time of the eruption, Kappelman and his colleagues analyzed oxygen and carbon isotopes, variations of the same element, from ostrich eggshells and fossilized mammal teeth. That work shed light on water intake and revealed the animals ate plants that were more likely to grow in drier conditions.

“The isotopes are incorporated in the hard tissues. So for the mammals, we look at their teeth, the enamel of their teeth, but we also find it in the eggshell of the ostrich,” he said.

An analysis of the site’s flora and fauna also found an abundance of fish remains in the aftermath of the eruption. The finding is perhaps not surprising given how near the site was to the river, but fish are rare in other Stone Age sites from the same period, the study noted.

“People start to increase the percentage of fish in the diet when Toba comes in. They’re capturing and processing almost four times as much fish (as before the eruption),” he said.

“We think the reason for that is because if Toba is in fact, creating more aridity, that means it’s going to be a shorter wet season, which means longer dry season.”

The team theorized that the drier climate, counterintuitively, explains the increased reliance on fish: As the river shrank, fish were trapped in water holes or shallower streams that hunters could more easily target.

Blue vs. green corridor

The fish-rich water holes may have potentially created what the team described as a “blue corridor,” along which early humans moved north out of Africa once they were depleted of fish. This theory contradicts most other models that suggest that humanity’s main migration out of Africa took place along “green corridors” during humid periods.

“This study … demonstrates the great plasticity of Homo sapiens populations and their ability to adapt easily to any type of environment, whether hyper-humid or hyper-arid, including during catastrophic events such as the hyper-explosion of the Toba volcano,” said Ludovic Slimak, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the University of Toulouse, in an email. Slimak was not involved in the research.

The study authors were also able to explore the geology of the ancient riverbed, which suggested that it flowed slower and lower at that point than in the present.

“We can do that by just looking at the cobbles,” Kappelman said. “A very energetic river can move bigger boulders and cobbles than a river that isn’t that (energetic.) What (cobbles) we find for the ancestor river are smaller than the river today.”

The excavation team was able to build a detailed picture of what happened at the site in Ethiopia around 74,000 years ago. Lawrence C. Todd

Oldest known arrowheads?

The researchers also uncovered the remains of several small triangular points, which tantalizingly rank among the earliest examples of the use of archery and provide clues that the site’s inhabitants might have used bows and arrows to hunt fish and other larger prey.

Slimak, who has studied similar points discovered in France that date back 50,000 years, agreed with the new study’s assessment of the artifacts.

“The authors also highlight very clear indicators suggesting the existence of archery here 74,000 years ago,” Slimak said. “There is therefore every reason to … consider these ancient Homo sapiens as bearers of already highly advanced technologies, largely emancipated from natural and climatic constraints, crucial factors for understanding their migrations later on, across all continents and under all latitudes.”

Ancient species of humans likely left Africa multiple times, but archaeologists and geneticists largely agree that the most significant dispersal of Homo sapiens, our own species — which ultimately led to modern humans living in every corner of the globe — took place around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.

The new research offers another potential scenario for how this dispersal happened while not ruling out previous theories, said Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader in human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who called it an “intriguing paper.”

“I’m sure each of these propositions will fuel debate amongst the relevant specialists but I think the authors have made a plausible (though not definitive) case for each scenario they propose,” Stringer said via email.

“Of course this new work doesn’t mean that humid corridors were not still important conduits for dispersals out of Africa, but this work adds credible additional possibilities during more arid phases.”",https://edition.cnn.com
69,Apple customers love Apple. The Biden administration thinks they could do better,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.

New York CNN —

The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Apple wants to break the company’s notoriously tight grip on the iPhone, the device that’s made it one of the biggest and most profitable companies on the planet.

But regardless of what happens in court, the case is already shining a light on the two faces of Apple: the cool, high-end tech brand that customers adore; and the ruthless, unavoidable behemoth that developers loathe.

Here’s the deal: The Feds say Apple is maintaining a monopoly that stifles competition, deprives consumers of choice and ultimately forces them to pay more.

Apple’s response to the allegations is, more or less, a) no we don’t, and b) good luck proving customer harm when everybody loves us.

And that’s where this Goliath versus Goliath battle gets interesting.

Customers really like Apple. We love the phones, the watches, the laptops and the AirPods that ensure we never have to be alone with our thoughts (unless, heaven help you, you forgot to charge them). Heck, I’m typing this article on an Apple keyboard connected to a MacBook connected to iCloud, and I would throw a fit if I had to switch to a PC.

Apple even nodded to this in its widely circulated statement to the media Thursday:

“We innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users.”

Magical!

The company added: “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”

And it’s true — the gods saw fit to get Steve Jobs and Jony Ive (the revered product designer behind Apple’s biggest hits) in the same room at the same time, and the world was never the same.

Their products married good design and good software. They were never cheap, but they were shiny, user-friendly, simply beautiful. With help from the best marketing team in Silicon Valley history, Apple became a tech icon with a billion devotees.

The darker side of Apple

But on the business side, Apple is not so beloved.

The company has a reputation for quashing competition and squeezing developers with exorbitant fees. Many smaller tech companies hate Apple as much as they live in fear of its lawyers.

“Apple has this practice of seeing what others innovate for the phone, copying it, and then making it so that those others can’t compete,” Adam Wolfson, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Quinn Emanuel, told me. (There’s even an industry term for when Apple appropriates a third party’s tech, called “Sherlocking” — a nod to one of Apple’s search products that rendered its non-Apple rival, Watson, redundant.)

“They very much have an approach to being about as sharp-elbowed as you can possibly get,” said Wolfson, who has represented clients in Apple disputes. “Apple is extraordinarily litigious, and will fight to the very last breath, because it can.”

The DOJ lawsuit argues Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by blocking innovative new apps and services.

If you’re an iPhone user and you’ve ever been in a text thread with someone using an Android device, you know the green-bubble problem and how annoying it is. It’s not as if Apple can’t make that experience better, according to the DOJ — it just doesn’t want to, because it’s better for Apple if its users see Android as a social faux pas. It’s tech tribalism, and Apple is a master at cultivating loyalty.

The green bubble issue is just one of several ways Apple is abusing its dominant position, according to the lawsuit. (My colleague David Goldman has more on that here.)

If it succeeds, the Justice Department could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach, which Apple says is meant to create a seamless experience for users and keep them relatively safe from viruses.

That is a concern for investors, says Gene Muster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, because the lawsuit goes after “the juiciest part of their business.”

But Muster doesn’t expect the lawsuit to be a body blow for the company, and believes “people will still gravitate to Apple products.”

Indeed, customer satisfaction is, paradoxically, a tricky issue for the DOJ as well. People are pretty content with their iPhones. Could we be more content with more competition? Maybe. The DOJ will have their work cut out for them trying to prove it.

Ultimately, Wolfson said, “the law wants to make sure that consumers are getting the absolute best, not just what Apple decides we want.”",https://edition.cnn.com
70,Judge tosses DOJ suit against social media influencers in alleged pump-and-dump scheme,"CNN —

A federal judge has dismissed a criminal indictment against seven Twitter users and a podcaster accused of running a $100 million stock manipulation scheme over social media.

The Justice Department did not do enough to describe the influencers’ activities as a “scheme to defraud,” wrote District Judge Andrew Hanen of the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in an order dated Wednesday.

In the indictment, the DOJ had alleged a lucrative “pump and dump” scheme in which the social media influencers used the messaging app Discord to promote certain stocks to their followers before selling their positions after a run-up in the stocks’ prices. The result was an alleged conspiracy by defendants “to unlawfully enrich themselves by pumping and dumping securities … through false and misleading posts and material omissions on Twitter [and Discord].”

At least one of the defendants whose account CNN previously reviewed had tweeted about Gamestop and AMC, two so-called “meme stocks” that saw significant public interest and trading in 2021.

On Wednesday, however, Hanen wrote that while the defendants may well have intended to separate followers from their money, the evidence did not support a finding of actual securities fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud.

“The key question is whether one statement by one of the co-defendants that ‘we’re robbing … idiots of their money,’ which is alleged in the Indictment, is sufficient,” the judge wrote. “This statement sufficiently alleges ‘intent to defraud’ … but does not on its own sufficiently allege that Defendants executed, or conspired to execute, a ‘scheme to defraud’ investors of money or property” as defined by court precedent.

Unlike a traditional fraud case, Hanen added, the DOJ merely claimed investors were deprived of relevant market information — not that the influencers directly stole money from investors.

The indictment was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could potentially be amended and refiled.

The DOJ case is distinct from a civil suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission around the same time against those same defendants and that accused them of violating US securities law. The SEC’s case is currently on hold, after the Justice Department asked the court in January 2023 to stay that lawsuit while its own criminal case against the defendants unfolded.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.

71,Why America says Apple is a monopoly,"New York CNN —

“Buy your mom an iPhone.”

That was Apple CEO Tim Cook’s famous response at Vox’s 2022 Code Conference, when a reporter complained that her mother couldn’t see the videos she texted to her mom’s Android phone because they were grainy and slow.

It’s also a quip that US Attorney General Merrick Garland quoted – and sharply criticized – Thursday at a press conference announcing the Justice Department’s landmark antitrust lawsuit against Apple, in which the Biden administration and 16 states allege Apple is illegally abusing the iPhone’s monopoly power in the smartphone market.

The massive lawsuit against one of the world’s largest companies claims Apple is breaking the law by carefully curating its app store and customer experience, designed to lure customers in and keep them buying Apple products and services – to the exclusion of competitors.

Apple, in a statement, said it disagreed with the lawsuit and would fight it vigorously.

“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,” the company said.

If successful, the suit could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach to hardware and software. It could be made to open up its iPhone to alternative app stores and its technologies like iMessage with Android phones.

The Justice Department, in its complaint, highlighted five ways it says Apple is abusing its dominant position to the detriment of Americans.

Green bubbles

With iMessage, Apple created an enhanced text messaging service that allows people to seamlessly communicate with one another, sending rich text, high-quality video and audio that uploads almost instantly – as long as it’s sent to another iPhone customer.

When those messages get sent to people with Android phones, they appear grainy, they can be slow to load , and they can miss out on key features like emoji responses, editing functionality and end-to-end encryption. The dreaded “green bubbles” that mark Android users within iMessage – and particularly the lower-quality performance – are illegal, the Justice Department alleges.

“As any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message, or received a tiny, grainy video can attest — Apple’s anticompetitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-Apple products,” Garland said on Thursday. “As a result, iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse — even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging. And it does so intentionally.”

Apple last year said it would adopt a new standard of technology for communication with Android phones that will open up some, but not all, of those features. The green bubbles will remain.

Apple Pay exclusivity

Apple helped revolutionize the way we pay for things, tying customers’ credit cards to technology inside iPhones to make payments more secure and seamless. And Apple takes a tiny payment for each transaction.

But Apple Pay is the only way iPhone owners can pay for stuff using that technology on an iPhone. Apple, citing security reasons, doesn’t allow third-party apps to access the chip that allows for iPhones to make mobile payments. It also could entice some customers to stick with iPhones when they’d otherwise switch to a competitor, the lawsuit alleges.

“Apple also deprives users of the benefits and innovations third-party wallets would provide,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Cross-platform digital wallets would offer an easier, more seamless, and potentially more secure way for users to switch from the iPhone to another smartphone.”

Making rivals less useful than Apple Watch

Apple Watch, one of Apple’s most successful products, is not compatible with Android phones – on purpose, the Justice Department alleges.

Although some smartwatches work seamlessly with any kind of smartphone, Apple Watches, a market leader, require iPhones to operate. That locks customers into Apple’s ecosystem of hardware and software, forcing Apple Watch customers to buy iPhones.

“Apple uses smartwatches, a costly accessory, to prevent iPhone customers from choosing other phones,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Having copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party developers, Apple now prevents those developers from innovating and limits the Apple Watch to the iPhone to prevent a negative ‘impact to iPhone sales.’”

Banning third-party app stores

The only way to get apps on an iPhone is through Apple’s proprietary app store. Apple has long claimed that its approach to maintaining what apps can and cannot be used on an iPhone helps customers. It prevents spam and harmful apps, Apple says.

It forces apps into Apple’s onerous limitations and expensive 30% commissions, the Justice Department argues. And it limits competition.

For example, the Justice Department cites cloud-based gaming app stores as a service that Apple illegally prevents from appearing on an iPhone. Companies that want to stream games to customers have to load each individual game to the app store, which prevents companies from marketing and selling potentially powerful and popular competitive technology to customers.

Restricting super apps

Apple forces app developers to write code specifically for its operating system, restricting developers from coding using universal languages that could offer a single app experience across any device.

That prevents apps from becoming “super apps” – apps that run identically on Apple’s iOS iPhone operating system and Google’s Android OS. Apple also restricts “mini programs” – apps within apps that effectively run on the web. The Justice Department says that requirement locks developers into Apple’s system.

“Since at least 2017, Apple has arbitrarily imposed exclusionary requirements that unnecessarily and unjustifiably restrict mini programs and super apps,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Apple exerted its control over app distribution to stifle others’ innovation.”",https://edition.cnn.com
72,Apple sued in a landmark iPhone monopoly lawsuit,"Washington CNN —

The US Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.

It’s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the US government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.

The complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that ”Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.”

“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,” he added.

The long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling – and in some cases, restricting – how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth’s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.

The company said it denied the lawsuit’s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government “to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”

But Garland on Thursday said Apple’s actions have wide-ranging effects.

“Monopolies like Apple’s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,” Garland said Thursday.

“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there’s a law for that,” he added.

For example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message – but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.

The company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors’ products are far more limited in their capabilities.

“Apple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,” Garland said on Thursday.

‘We will vigorously defend against it’

This year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone’s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.

And Apple maintains a 30% commission on most sales through its app store – a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple’s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.

“We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,” Apple said in a statement.

Thursday’s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.

Apple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a “dangerous precedent” and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.

“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in its statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”

The changes the DOJ wants from Apple

Thursday’s lawsuit against Apple seeks three specific remedies that could dramatically change the company’s business model.

The Justice Department wants a court order barring Apple from using its app store to block innovative new apps. It also wants the court to block Apple-imposed restrictions that prevent other messaging apps, smartwatches, digital wallets and other technologies from integrating with the iPhone.

It also called for the court to prevent Apple from using its contractual terms to “obtain, maintain, extend, or entrench” the company’s alleged monopoly.

The complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN, does not explicitly call for a breakup of Apple. But it did not rule out the possibility, and asks for “relief as needed to cure any competitive harm.”

According to the complaint, the list of participating states or districts in the suit include New Jersey, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Years of scrutiny

Apple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.

But the Justice Department’s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple’s practices.

The case represents the Biden administration’s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under US antitrust law.

Apple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold “monopoly power.” Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.

The legal action could weigh on Apple’s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.

Apple’s (AAPL) stock fell 3% Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.

Along with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration’s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.

The Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden’s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.

Along with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.

Apps vs Apple

To solve Android phone customers’ “green bubble” issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.

“It lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,” Migicovsky said. “Technologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.”

Those kind of interactions have made Apple’s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.

Beginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game “Fortnite.”

Apple isn’t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.

Those rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don’t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.

Europe’s bite at Apple

The US government isn’t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.

In a seismic move to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.

But critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.

Upstart turned behemoth

Since its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It’s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple’s restrictiveness.

In the era led by founder Steve Jobs, “Apple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,” said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. “Apple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.”

Now, however, Apple’s advances are more “incremental” than earth-shattering, Bailey added. “[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.”

“Apple’s financially healthy,” Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is “dimming.”

73,Apple’s Tim Cook goes on China charm offensive to revive flagging iPhone sales,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong/Beijing CNN —

Tim Cook is making a high-profile visit to China that coincides with Apple opening a huge new store in Shanghai — its second biggest in the world. It’s all part of a push by the company to reverse a decline in iPhone sales in its most important international market.

The new $11.6 million outlet — located in Shanghai’s central district of Jing’an, which is named after a historic temple — is the biggest in China and the second only to Apple’s flagship store on New York’s Fifth Avenue, Chinese state media reported.

“Nonghao Shanghai!” Apple CEO Cook said in a Weibo post on Wednesday, which means “hello” in Shanghainese. “I’m always so happy to be back in this remarkable city.”

Cook said he had spent the morning enjoying a traditional breakfast of what appeared to be soup dumplings and soy milk and taking selfies along the city’s famous Bund waterfront with local actor Zheng Kai.

In Shanghai, mainland China’s financial hub, Apple now has eight stores, the largest number of any city in the country. There are currently 47 Apple stores in 24 cities across mainland China.

The new addition comes as Apple (AAPL) tries to fend off competitors and revive sales in a rocky market with growing headwinds, ranging from an economic slowdown to geopolitical tensions and rising nationalist sentiment.

In 2023, Apple grabbed the top spot in China’s smartphone market for the first time ever, with a record 17.3% market share, according to IDC Research.

But during the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales in the country slumped 24% from a year ago, according to a separate report by Counterpoint Research from earlier this month. Apple’s market share slid behind that of Vivo, Huawei, and Honor in that period, it added, while rival Huawei’s sales soared 64%.

Cook’s visit, his third to the country in a year, underscores China’s significance to Apple as its biggest overseas market and a critical part of its manufacturing supply chain.

“China remains a critical market for Apple, particularly in the premium segment above $800, where it holds a dominant position,” said Ivan Lam, senior analyst from Counterpoint.

“With Huawei’s resurgence and other Chinese [phone makers] gaining traction in offline sales, Apple is proactively strengthening its offline presence, leveraging flagship stores as a key tool to promote high-end smartphones,” he said.

Earlier this month, Apple announced it would expand its research center in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen later this year.

“China is the heart and lungs of Apple’s growth strategy as Cupertino doubles down on its China strategy with these moves,” said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities.

No supply chain ‘more critical’

On Wednesday, Cook hosted an information sharing session along with three of Apple’s suppliers — BYD, Lens Technology and Everwin Precision Technology — at its Shanghai office, according to state media reports.

“There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to Apple than that of China,” Cook told a group of reporters.

He met with Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, the world’s largest electrical vehicle maker, at the session, according to a video he posted on his Weibo account.

Cook praised Chinese suppliers as having “the most advanced manufacturing in the world,” according to China Daily.

The Apple CEO also visited a film production studio, talked with mobile game developers and took photos with a crowd of shoppers and staff, according to his social media posts.

“Cook is not taking a step back from China. It’s the opposite as competition from Huawei ramps up domestically,” Ives said.

Apple still has many fans in the country. More than a hundred of them waited in line overnight to be among the first to enter the new store or to get a photo with Cook, according to videos and state media reports circulated on Weibo.

Others told CNN they were planning to go.

“I’ll go and kinda ‘worship’ the store,” said Dolores, a movie producer in Beijing. She has been using the iPhone, iPad and MacBook for years. “I’ve already grown used to its design and the system,” she said, calling the products “sleek and beautiful.”

Wei, a Beijing resident, also said he would visit.

“I’ve heard that it’s quite big,” he said. “I just want to have a look.”

Both said they would stay loyal to the brand, despite rising calls on the Chinese internet for consumers to switch to homegrown brands to show their patriotism.

“Some Chinese brands like Huawei are also doing well with their products. But [I won’t switch.] It should be about mutual achievement [for Apple and Chinese brands], rather than hostility,” Dolores said.

“For international products, if you like a brand, there should be no geopolitical divisions,” Wei said. “Just look at the products.”",https://edition.cnn.com
74,Dubai photographer reveals the UAE’s hidden wildlife,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights.

CNN —

In a country best known for its soaring skyscrapers, modern architecture and sprawling desert, wildlife isn’t always what comes to mind when people think of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But Dubai-based photographer Anish Karingattil is determined to change that.

Originally from India, Karingattil moved to Dubai 17 years ago and began photographing wildlife shortly after, specializing in macro photography, using extreme close ups. Highlights of his stunning portfolio of images, taken across the seven Emirates, include a scorpion with her babies, an Arabian horned viper hiding in the desert sand, and two black and yellow mud daubers covered in dew drops.

“Photographers get to tell a story through images,” Karingattil says. “Macro photography allows me to see life and the world around me in a brand-new way.”

Despite its hot climate and harsh desert, the UAE is home to over 1,000 plant and animal species. The waters around the country are home to the largest concentration of Indian Ocean humpbacks dolphin in the world, and the second-largest population of dugongs, after Australia.

With the UAE’s president recently extending the country’s “Year of Sustainability” into 2024, Karingattil uses wildlife photography as a method of capturing the country’s biodiversity and sharing it with others.

While interior design is his full-time job, “herping” is his passion. “Herping is the act of observing, studying, and photographing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats,” says Karingattil. “It is a popular hobby among nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers who are fascinated by the diversity and beauty of these creatures.”

Some snakes found in the UAE, including this saw-scaled viper, are aggressive and highly venomous. Anish Karingattil

But photographing potentially dangerous animals like snakes and spiders takes a lot of preparation. Before attempting to photograph any wildlife, Karingattil says it is important to research its behavior, habitat and potential risks to understand how to approach it safely and minimize the risk of harm to both the photographer and the animal.

For Karingattil, conservation is an important aspect of wildlife photography, which he believes can serve as a powerful tool for advocacy.

“By documenting the beauty and fragility of the natural world, photographers can help policymakers and the general public understand the value of protecting the environment and the need for sustainable practices,” he says. And with over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil uses social media to educate people about the species he photographs.

Biodiversity in the UAE

The UAE has 49 terrestrial and marine protected areas, including eight in Dubai. Accounting for over 18% of the country’s land territory and 12% of its marine and coastal territory, these protected areas are often natural reserves which include all the major ecosystems found in the region: mountain, desert, coastal and marine.

Andrew Gardner, associate director of Biodiversity Conservation at Emirates Nature-WWF, says wildlife conservation is recognized as an “important responsibility and obligation by the UAE.” For example, the country is a signatory to multiple international conservation conventions, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has helped reintroduce animals such as the Arabian oryx to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Gardner, there are now over 1,600 oryx in two of the UAE’s protected areas, and thousands more in zoos across the region.

However, rapid development and population growth across the Emirates mean that “53% of bird species, 46.7% of mammal species, 19% of reptile species, and 8% of plant species” are endangered, according to a government report.

It was Karingattil's long-term desire to photograph a scorpion, so when he came across this scorpion with her babies, he couldn't let the chance pass by. Anish Karingattil

Gardner says the Arabian wolf and striped hyena have both gone extinct from the UAE in recent decades, and a small population of Arabian leopards that lived the Hajar Mountains until the mid-1990s are now also believed to be extinct.

Karingattil points to habitat loss, climate change and overfishing as some of the major threats facing wildlife in the UAE, but one issue he thinks people should take more action against is plastic pollution.

“Whenever I explore the desert or other areas, I make it a point to clean up the surroundings,” he says. “By removing litter and debris, we can reduce the impact of human activities on the natural world.”",https://edition.cnn.com
75,Aeternitas Tower: Dubai is building the world’s tallest residential clock tower,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.

CNN —

Dubai is set to add another towering figure to its skyline.

The Aeternitas Tower, officially unveiled at a launch event last week, will be the world’s tallest residential clock tower at a staggering 450 meters (1,476 feet) tall — more than four times the height of London’s Big Ben, and just 22 meters (72 feet) short of the world’s tallest residential building, the Central Park Tower in New York City.

Set to become the world’s second-tallest clock tower (after the Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia), Aeternitas Tower is the result of a partnership between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller.

London Gate purchased the plot of land in Dubai Marina, which already had the beginnings of an unfinished 106-story structure — and knew that the tower’s monumental size needed a striking facade, said Tom Hill, media relations coordinator for the developer.

“We believe the clock will be seen from six kilometers away because of the sheer height of the building,” said Hill, adding that the clock face will be an enormous 40 meters (131 feet) tall and 30 meters (98 feet) wide.

“We wanted to do something different that hasn’t been done before in Dubai,” said Hill.

At 450 meters (1,476 feet) tall, the residences will tower over the neighboring skyscrapers in Dubai Marina and will replace Marina 101 as the city's second-tallest building London Gate

A timeless tower

The residential tower comprises 649 units, with a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments, in addition to villa and mansion duplexes.

With housekeeping, a concierge service, and a 24-hour valet and porter, residents will have access to hotel-like services and facilities, but with the privacy and comfort of home.

Its shared amenities range from health facilities, including a gym, padel court, spa, yoga studio, and swimming pool, to arts and culture spaces such as a cinema, music room, and library.

The project will be handed over to residents in 2027, according to London Gate.

The tower’s name means “eternity” in Latin, and is inspired by the Franck Muller Aeternitas watch collection — one of the brand’s most complex designs which features an “eternal calendar,” said Erol Baliyan, managing director of Franck Muller in the Middle East and Africa.

The Swiss watchmaker sees its step into real estate as a move that will help create a monument that “mirrors the brand’s innovation, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance,” said Baliyan.

Aside from the striking clock face (inspired by Franck Muller’s art deco-style Long Island Collection, which has irregular squashed and stretched numbers in a rectangular case), the watchmaker will infuse its design ethos throughout the residence, said Baliyan.

He highlights luxury materials like brushed and polished metals, that will be contrasted with marble surfaces, textured fabrics and bold colors. Meanwhile, in the lobby and reception, the signature oblong face of the brand’s Curvex watch is represented with curved walls, archways, and oval furnishings.

“Attention to detail is paramount, with meticulously crafted joinery and carefully arranged lighting and furniture, ensuring a refined ambiance,” said Baliyan.

A booming market

The Aeternitas Tower is part of a growing trend in Dubai. Luxury property is booming in the Emirate, and branded residences — collaborations between designer brands and property developers — are surging in popularity.

As of October 2023, there were 51 completed projects in the city, a figure that is expected to double by 2030, according to Savills Research, with brands like fashion house Karl Lagerfeld, car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, and hoteliers 25Hours all announcing residential projects in the past year.

London Gate began phase one of its sales last week, with one-bedroom apartments starting at AED 1.6 million ($435,600).

“We’ve had an unbelievable level of interest since the launch,” said Hill, adding that in the first two days, London Gate sold around 30% of the initial 30-floor release, including all the available one-bedroom apartments.

The design for Aeternitas Tower was officially unveiled at a launch event on January 9 2024, at the Ritz-Carlton Dubai (pictured). London Gate

Hill believes that one factor driving interest is the tower’s location in Dubai Marina, where there’s a scarcity of sites for development, adding that an “iconic tower” like the Aeternitas is the first project of its kind to break ground in the district past few years.

While this is London Gate’s first branded residence project, it won’t be its last, said Hill, adding that the company will announce its next branded partnership by the end of Q1 this year.

As a rapidly evolving market, property in Dubai is often sold off-plan, with buyers waiting years to see their purchase. This is where branded residences provide an extra layer of security, particularly for overseas buyers, said Hill.

“When you have a brand as world-renowned as Franck Muller, for example […] you have that peace of mind that you’re going to be handed over a world-class product,” he added.",https://edition.cnn.com
76,Tosin Oshinowo on building a sustainable house in one of the world’s most exclusive neighborhoods,"Lagos, Nigeria CNN —

Architect Tosin Oshinowo is no stranger to versatility. She has designed one of the largest malls in Lagos, Nigeria, beach houses on the city’s coast and homes for internally displaced people in the north of the country. She also runs a bespoke furniture design company, and the Nigerian is the first African woman to curate the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, happening in the United Arab Emirates from November 2023 to March 2024.

In late 2022, she and her design practice, cmDesign Atelier (cmDA), also completed their first residential project in the ultra-exclusive Banana Island neighborhood in Lagos: “The Lantern House.”

Oshinowo says the Lantern House project, a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, three-story sustainable home, powered entirely by solar energy, was both exciting and a “slow labor of love.”

Contacted by her clients in September 2020, she, alongside her team and specialist contractors for various aspects of the home, started construction in January 2021 and ended last October.

Working on Banana Island

The 1.6 million-square meter (17 million-square feet), man-made Banana Island is named for its shape, and is a private, gated community in Nigeria’s commercial capital. (The exclusive area also made news in April, when a seven-story building under construction collapsed – adding to the list of building collapses in the greater Lagos State.)

With private power and water infrastructure systems, property on the island is some of the most expensive on the continent. That exclusivity was one of the main challenges for the Lantern House project, says Oshinowo, with strictly enforced restricted working hours that made looming deadlines difficult to meet.

Despite this, Oshinowo says seeing her vision come to life was fulfilling, adding that she’s proud of the end result. “It’s one thing to produce great conceptual design. It’s another thing to execute it to a seamless finish,” she said. “It’s such an exciting feeling to think that the decisions that you’ve made have worked.”

She says something the Lantern House project emphasized for her is that “being meticulous in the long run always pays off.” cmDA has since started working on another project on Banana Island.

A childhood dream

Oshinowo remembers wanting to be an architect from the age of 12, looking over floor plans and helping her father to design part of their holiday home when she was young. With degrees in architecture and urban design from the UK as well as an MBA in architecture, she worked for architecture firms in the UK and Europe before moving back to Nigeria in 2009.

The Lantern House features five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, and large wardrobes such as this one. Tolulope Sanusi/Rubyspolaroid Photography/cmDesign Atelier

The award-winning architect says she founded cmDA in 2012 out of a need to create a strong aesthetic language; one that also projected a contemporary and progressive cultural identity of Africa. “(It’s) very important to create architecture that, as much as possible, can be delivered from what is available in country,” Oshinowo added. “And also in doing that, starting to think about issues to do with sustainability and responsibility towards the environment.”

This bent towards sustainability is something the 43-year-old has carried into her curatorial role for this year’s upcoming Sharjah Architecture Triennial. The theme Oshinowo came up with is “The beauty of impermanence and the architecture of adaptability” which, she says, looks at under-celebrated innovations in the global south that deal with conditions of scarcity. She adds that she hopes the triennial will be an engaging space for the international community.

“It’s a validation to know that coming from Nigeria, practicing as a Black female architect in West Africa, that my work is not just relevant to the context of where we find ourselves now,” Oshinowo said, “in terms of importance relating to sustainability (and) adaptability, but also to equity.”",https://edition.cnn.com

CNN —

Dubai is making a splash with its most recent record-setting structure.

The newly opened twin skyscrapers One Za’abeel are home to the world’s longest cantilever building and on it, the United Arab Emirates’ longest suspended infinity pool, which is 120 meters (393 feet) in length.

A cantilever is a structure that is only connected at one end, and projects horizontally unsupported, like a diving board. The one at One Za’abeel is part of a 230-meter-long (755-foot) structure known as “The Link,” with the cantilever projecting 67.5 meters (221 feet) over the city.

The Link connects the luxury development’s two towers, providing a space for shared facilities and lifestyle amenities, says Fadi Jabri, CEO of Nikken Sekkei Dubai, the architecture firm behind the building.

“Levitating in the air,” the giant glass corridor is an engineering marvel — but it’s not just for show, says Jabri.

The site is bisected by a six-lane highway, which meant building facilities at ground level was not possible, and “there was this need to rejoin those sites,” he explains. The property’s developers negotiated the use of the space below and above the road, allowing them to connect the two towers with a shopping mall beneath the road, and the Link above.

Twenty-five meters (82 feet) high and wide, the cantilever contains three stories and is a key destination for the building’s hotel guests and residents, says Badr Benryane, director of food and beverage at the One&Only Za’abeel resort, which occupies the top 30 floors of one of the towers.

“In the absence of a beach and other water-based activities, our guests will have The Link as their playground,” says Benryane.

“It’s been inspired by the bustling streets of big cities around the world: it’s a futuristic boulevard, so as you walk down the middle of The Link, you will have different dining experiences.”

The Link’s eight restaurants include Tapasake, a poolside Nikkei restaurant serving up Japanese-Peruvian dishes. “On one end, there’s the restaurant with a terrace and indoor seating, and on the other is the pool club where we have amazing VIP cabanas, loungers and daybeds,” says Benryane.

Having taken a dip in the pool himself, Benryane says it’s one of the highlights of the space. “You’re basically in that infinity pool with nothing below you,” he says, adding: “You’re swimming amongst the clouds and overlooking the city — it’s beautiful.”

Temperature regulated and featuring underwater speakers, the unique bathing spot is open to hotel guests and One Za’abeel residents, although tourists and Dubai residents can gain access with a pool day pass, starting from 1,000 dirhams ($272) per person, and going up to $10,000 for VIP cabanas that come equipped with their own sound system, air conditioning, showers, dining rooms and private garden.

Dubai is home to several record-setting pools: in 2021, the Aura Skypool became the world’s highest 360-degree infinity pool, and the world’s tallest infinity pool inside a building is the 293.9-meter-high (964.2 feet) pool on the 77th floor of the Address Beach Resort in Dubai’s Jumeirah Gate.

The Link’s 100-meter (328 feet) elevation and floor-to-ceiling windows provide 360-degree views across the city to the desert beyond, from which the building gets its name (“Za’abeel means the white sands of the region,” explains Badr).

The cantilever isn’t just important for the building’s social space, but also its design: the two towers were built leaning slightly out, so the weight of The Link would pull them both in, strengthening the overall structure, says Jabri.

Weighing nearly 10,000 tons, it was constructed in eight parts and lifted into place with cranes over three days, which required the road below to be closed on several occasions. The $1 billion project was originally expected to open in late 2021, but was delayed by Covid.",https://edition.cnn.com
78,"Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course: The Grove XXIII","CNN —

There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.

But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.

Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.

The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.

For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”

And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.

Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.

With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.

A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.

“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.

“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”

The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.

Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.

Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.

“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.

“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”

“Slaughterhouse 23”

Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.

Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.

Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.

Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.

The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.

“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.

Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”

“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.

Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.

“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.

“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”

To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.

Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.

The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.

“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.

Taking a swing

Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.

Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.

The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.

“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.

The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.

Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.

“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.

“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”

The elephant in the roof

Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath.

Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through.

Customization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagram after a round at the course in March 2021.

Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client.

“He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said.

“We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.”

“No other place I’d rather be”

Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round.

When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug.

“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled.

“That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic.

“He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”",https://edition.cnn.com
79,Close-up Photographer of the Year: Images show the hidden wonders of nature,"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.

CNN —

Mesmerizing photos of ants firing acid, a shrimp floating over a rainbow-colored mosaic sea star, and a butterfly peering in at a wedding party are among the winning images of the Close-up Photographer of the Year 2023 competition.

The contest, in its fifth year, celebrates micro and macro photography, striving to show the hidden wonders of the natural world, from microscopic fungi to majestic animals. Micro is the term used for taking photos of tiny subjects that require magnification, while macro involves capturing close-up images of larger subjects.

Tracy Calder, co-founder of the competition and jury member, told CNN how the photos reveal unusual interactions between animals and plants, demonstrating how everything in the natural world is interconnected and interdependent. It “celebrates animals and behavior that people have never seen or encountered before,” she said.

This year’s grand prize went to Hungarian photographer Csaba Daróczi, for his black and white image of a Eurasian nuthatch soaring through a forest. Taken with a GoPro from inside a hollowed-out tree stump, the striking image offers a new perspective of the bird against the backdrop of outstretched trees.

The title of young close-up photographer of the year went to 17-year-old Spaniard Carlos Pérez Naval for his image of a Moorish gecko on a wall covered with pyrolusite crystals. “These magnesium minerals create stunning formations, which look just like petrified trees, but they are so small that they’re tricky to spot,” he said in a press release.

“I wanted to capture a gecko in the ‘petrified forest’ for a long time, but they only recently appeared in my village – probably carried in fruit baskets from hotter areas. Due to climate change they can now survive here,” he added.

The jury – made up of 23 photographers, scientists and naturalists – chose the winning photos for each category from a total of 12,000 entries from 67 countries. Many were taken in areas local to the photographers, showing the beauty of what can be seen in your own backyard, said Calder.

She, along with her husband Daniel, founded the competition in 2018. Both are professional photographers. While many other photo awards feature close-up categories, they believed there was a need for an entire competition dedicated to macro and micro photography.

“It’s often easier for people to get behind conservation stories featuring ‘cute’ or more obvious animals and plants: rhinos, pandas, orchids. But the lesser-known insects and plants we often consider weeds have a huge role to play in keeping everything balanced. Close-up photography often showcases these animals and plants,” she said.

“There’s also a joy in showing people things they wouldn’t be able to see without a macro lens or microscope. Many of the creatures and plants we show are all around us but are never noticed. The competition is a way for them to be noticed,” she added.",https://edition.cnn.com
80,Pope Francis skips homily at Palm Sunday Mass in rare move,"CNN —

Pope Francis unexpectedly skipped delivering his homily during the Palm Sunday Mass service at the Vatican on Sunday, although was able to preside over the service and was later driven around in the popemobile.

The service marks the beginning of Holy Week, the most sacred week in the church’s calendar as Christians around the world prepare to celebrate Easter, and his decision to skip the homily (reflection) was a surprise.

The 87-year-old has in recent weeks had aides read out several of his speeches after suffering from a bout of ill health, which on 28 February saw him go to hospital for tests.

Over the winter months, Francis has battled with bouts of bronchitis, cold and flu.

While the pope has occasionally skipped homilies on Easter Sunday, it is the first time he has not given a homily on Palm Sunday.

Francis did speak during the Mass, reading prayers and giving his blessing. He also prayed the Angelus at the conclusion of the liturgy, beforehand recalling the “martyred people of Ukraine” and those suffering from war.

At the end of the liturgy, he greeted cardinals individually from his wheelchair, which he has been using for several months. He then got into the popemobile to greet some of the thousands of people gathered in the square.

Following the service, he also condemned the “vile” concert hall shooting in Moscow. Francis told the crowd at St. Peter’s Square that he was praying for the “victims of the vile terrorist attack,” the worst that Russia has suffered in recent decades.

On Saturday, the pope met with employees from Italian state broadcaster RAI where he delivered a speech and on 8 March spoke at length at a parish in Rome.

Holy Week and Easter is an intense schedule for the pope. He is to travel to a prison outside of Rome on Thursday to celebrate the foot washing ritual with female prisoners, and on Good Friday be present at services in St Peter’s and the Colosseum.

On Easter Saturday evening he’s due to preside at a long evening liturgy and on Easter Sunday offer his “Urbi et Orbi” blessing to the city of Rome and the world.",https://edition.cnn.com
81,"Madison Tevlin, star of the Down Syndrome awareness ad, smashes assumptions about her condition","CNN —

What happens when others assume people with Down syndrome can’t hit hard, aim high or drink a darn margarita?

Well, it can become a reality.

A new Down syndrome awareness ad cuts right to the philosophical heart of this often-misunderstood condition, reminding us that the way we treat people with Down syndrome can help smash false limits — or reinforce them.

False limits like, say, someone of-age not being able to drink just because they have Down syndrome.

“If your assumptions become reality, then assume I can drink a margarita. So you serve me a margarita, so I drink a margarita,” says actress Madison Tevlin in the now-viral ad.

The same goes for things like living alone, having sex or any other achievement, both great and small.

“Assume that I can, so maybe I will,” the spot concludes.

ASSUME THAT I CAN | World Down Syndrome Day 2024

The ad, created by an Italian Down syndrome organization called Coor Down, was released in recognition of World Down Syndrome Awareness Day, March 21. Its tagline, #AssumeICan, is being used by people with Down Syndrome to show that many of the assumptions about their drive and abilities are just that … assumptions.

Tevlin, the 22-year-old actress who starred in the ad, talked to CNN about tearing down stereotypes while also celebrating the differences people with Down syndrome bring to the table.

“When I was born, the doctor told my mom and dad that life would be really hard for me, saying that I can’t talk, or walk, or dance, or model, or act — or drinking or getting married — any of this stuff that’s part of normal life,” she said. “And it’s so much fun proving people wrong.”

Tevlin was connected to the Coor Down campaign through the National Down Syndrome Society, and says she’s loving the reactions to the ad, which has 160,000 views on YouTube and has been burning up social media feeds.

“I’m just so happy everyone looks up to me as a role model.”

Other Down syndrome activists and achievers are sharing their own ways they defy stereotypes, like 17-year-old triathlete Caleb Prewitt, or members of the Hijinx Theatre, an inclusive theatre company in Wales.

Down syndrome is a condition caused by an extra partial or full chromosome. According to the National Down Syndrome Society, one in 772 babies in the US is born with Down Syndrome. It’s not a disease or an affliction, it’s just the way some people are made.

While Down syndrome results in slight cognitive delays, the NDSS says these issues are usually “mild to moderate” and don’t affect people’s ability to vote, contribute to their communities or make decisions about their own lives.

As an actress and advocate, Tevlin has taken control of her own life. She says getting past stereotypes about Down syndrome allows the whole person to shine through.

“I always say that I have Down syndrome, and it’s the least interesting thing about me,” she said. “The part of who I am, well it’s not all of me. We should all celebrate our differences in our own special and unique ways.”

82,"Catherine, Princess of Wales, announces she has cancer","London CNN —

Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed Friday she has been diagnosed with cancer and is in the “early stages” of treatment.

The princess, known as Kate, described her diagnosis as a “huge shock” in a video statement released on social media. The news comes two months after she had temporarily stepped away from public life following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition.

“In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous,” said Catherine, 42, who is married to the heir to the British throne, Prince William.

“The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.”

Kate continued that “William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.”

The princess added, “As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be ok.”

Kate said that she had told them she is “well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits.”

She praised Prince William for being by her side as “a great source of comfort and reassurance” as well as the support she has received from the public.

“We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery,” the princess said.

She ended her heartfelt message by saying that she was also keeping “all those whose lives have been affected by cancer” in her thoughts.

“For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone,” Kate concluded in the video statement, which was filmed by BBC Studios at Windsor on Wednesday.

CNN understands the Prince and Princess of Wales wanted to wait for their young children to be out of school for the Easter holidays before making the announcement.

Prince William has been balancing supporting his wife and children while continuing his public-facing duties and will continue to do so, a royal source told CNN.

The princess started preventative chemotherapy in late February, the source said, adding that Kate had been expected to return to official duties after Easter, however she will now postpone further work until she has been cleared to do so by her medical team.

Kensington Palace is not expected to reveal any further medical details such as the type of cancer or what stage it is.

Preventative chemotherapy is often used after surgery as an “adjuvant” therapy, to weaken the chances of cancer returning, Dr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, told CNN.

The news is a devastating blow for the British monarchy and comes as King Charles III is currently undergoing treatment for an unspecified cancer, which was announced by Buckingham Palace in early February.

King Charles said he was “so proud” of Catherine, his daughter-in-law, for “her courage in speaking as she did” in sharing her cancer diagnosis, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said late Friday.

Charles said he “remained in the closest contact” with Kate since they received treatment at the same London hospital, and that he and Queen Camilla will “continue to offer their love and support to the whole family through this difficult time.”

Kate was admitted to The London Clinic, a private hospital in the city, on January 16 and successfully underwent a planned abdominal surgery, Kensington Palace said at the time. She remained in the hospital for 13 days following the procedure and, on doctor’s advice, had since been away from public duties during her recovery.

Kate was spotted in public for the first time since her surgery, visiting a farm shop with her husband Prince William last weekend, amid intense speculation about her health and whereabouts.

Since the announcement on Friday, well wishes have poured in for the princess.

Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex said in a joint statement that they “wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.”

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement that the princess had “the love and support of the whole country,” adding that Kate had shown “tremendous bravery” and that she had been “unfairly treated” during weeks of “intense scrutiny” by the press and on social media. He added that his thoughts were with her and “in particular her three children.”

British opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer also sent his “best wishes” to the princess, saying that the “lurid speculation” of recent weeks must have “added” to her stress.

Meanwhile, the White House said the update from the princess was “terrible” and that the administration was “incredibly sad to hear of the news.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration’s thoughts were with the royal and her family “during this incredibly difficult time, and certainly we wish her a full recovery.”

Jean-Pierre stressed it was “important that we respect their privacy, especially at this time, so I’m not going to go further than that.”",https://edition.cnn.com
83,"Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds","CNN —

In a trailblazing study, researchers have discovered bottled water sold in stores can contain 10 to 100 times more bits of plastic than previously estimated — nanoparticles so infinitesimally tiny they cannot be seen under a microscope.

At 1,000th the average width of a human hair, nanoplastics are so teeny they can migrate through the tissues of the digestive tract or lungs into the bloodstream, distributing potentially harmful synthetic chemicals throughout the body and into cells, experts say.

One liter of water — the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters — contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven types of plastics, of which 90% were identified as nanoplastics and the rest were microplastics, according to the study.

Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter.

“This study, I have to say, is exceedingly impressive. The body of work that they put into this was really quite profound. … I would call it groundbreaking,” said Sherri “Sam” Mason, director of sustainability at Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the study.

The finding reinforces long-held expert advice to drink tap water from glass or stainless steel containers to reduce exposure, Mason said. That advice extends to other foods and drinks packaged in plastic as well, she added.

“People don’t think of plastics as shedding but they do,” she said. “In almost the same way we’re constantly shedding skin cells, plastics are constantly shedding little bits that break off, such as when you open that plastic container for your store-bought salad or a cheese that’s wrapped in plastic.”

How many nanoplastics are there?

Mason was the coauthor of a 2018 study that first detected the existence of micro- and nanoplastics in 93% of samples of bottled water sold by 11 different brands in nine countries.

In that past study, Mason found each tainted liter of water held an average of 10 plastic particles wider than a human hair, along with 300 smaller particles. Five years ago, however, there was no way to analyze those tiny flecks or discover if there were more.

“It’s not that we didn’t know nanoplastics existed. We just couldn’t analyze them,” Mason explained.

In the recent study, published in January 2024 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Columbia University presented a new technology that can see, count and analyze the chemical structure of nanoparticles in bottled water.

Instead of 300 per liter, the team behind the latest study found the actual number of plastic bits in three popular brands of water sold in the United States to be in between 110,000 and 370,000, if not higher. (The authors declined to mention which brands of bottled water they studied.)

However, the new technology was actually able to see millions of nanoparticles in the water, which could be “inorganic nanoparticles, organic particles and some other plastic particles not among the seven major plastic types we studied,” said coauthor and environmental chemist Beizhan Yan, an associate research professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

The innovative new techniques presented in the study open the door for further research to better understand the potential risks to human health, said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors committed to reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals, who was not involved in the study.

“They suggest widespread human exposures to minuscule plastic particles posing largely unstudied risks,” Houlihan said in an email. “Infants and young children may face the greatest risks, as their developing brains and bodies are often more vulnerable to impacts from toxic exposures.”

Dangers to human health

Nanoplastics are the most worrisome type of plastic pollution for human health, experts say. That’s because the minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, potentially interrupting cellular processes and depositing endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, per- and polyfluorinated substances, or PFAS, and heavy metals.

“All of those chemicals are used in the manufacturing of plastic, so if a plastic makes its way into us, it’s carrying those chemicals with it. And because the temperature of the body is higher than the outside, those chemicals are going to migrate out of that plastic and end up in our body,” Mason said.

“The chemicals can be carried to your liver and your kidney and your brain and even make their way across the placental boundary and end up in an unborn child,” Mason said.

In studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing baby 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles, said study coauthor Phoebe Stapleton, associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Rutgers University’s Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy in Piscataway, New Jersey.

“Micro and nanoplastics have been found in the human placenta at this point, Stapleton said. “They’ve been found in human lung tissues. They’ve been found in human feces; they’ve been found in human blood.”

In addition to the chemicals and toxic metals plastics may carry, another relatively unstudied area is whether the plastic polymer itself is also harming the body.

“The new frontier in plastics is understanding the polymers — the plastic part of plastic,” Mason said. “We’ve been very limited in our ability to understand the potential impact of the polymers on human health because we have not been able to detect down to that level. Now, with this new approach, we will be able to start doing so.”

CNN reached out to the International Bottled Water Association, which represents the industry, for a response to the study’s findings.

“This new method needs to be fully reviewed by the scientific community and more research needs to be done to develop standardized methods for measuring and quantifying nanoplastics in our environment,” a spokesperson for the association told CNN via email.

“There currently is both a lack of standardized methods and no scientific consensus on the potential health impacts of nano- and microplastic particles. Therefore, media reports about these particles in drinking water do nothing more than unnecessarily scare consumers.”

Which plastics are you swallowing?

The study’s new method of identifying nanoparticles in bottled water relies on a modified version of Raman spectroscopy, a laser-based technique that can analyze the chemical composition of cells by measuring how molecules vibrate in response to light.

The altered version, called stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, or SRS, adds a second laser to “amplify the previous signal by several orders of magnitude, allowing the previously unseen nanoparticle to be detected,” said senior author Wei Min, a professor of chemistry at Columbia University in New York City, who coinvented SRS in 2008.

“This study is the first one to apply this microscopy to the nanoplastic world,” Min said.

By dramatically boosting the image, SRS can clearly identify and capture images of nanoparticles in microseconds rather than the hours needed by the older technique — and do so without harming the tissues being imaged.

“But seeing the particles is not good enough because how do you know this is plastic or not? To do that we developed a new machine-based learning technology that allows us to identify and classify which plastic it is,” Yan said.

At the time of publication, the study’s algorithm was able to identify seven types of plastics: polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate.

“Based on other studies we expected most of the microplastics in bottled water would come from leakage of the plastic bottle itself, which is typically made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic,” said lead author Naixin Qian, a doctoral student in chemistry at Columbia University.

“However, we found there’s actually many diverse types of plastics in a bottle of water, and that different plastic types have different size distributions,” she said. “The PET particles were larger, while others were down to 200 nanometers, which is much, much smaller.”

Studies have found that particles of PET plastics can be broken off by repeatedly opening and closing the cap of the bottle, crushing the bottle or subjecting it to heat, such as in a car.

Much more research to be done

Now that nanoplastics can be identified and classified, it’s possible to research the answer to all sorts of questions. For example, if the nanoplastics floating in the bottled water weren’t from the bottle itself, where did they come from? The Columbia team is investigating a hypothesis that the other nanoplastics may come from source water, perhaps tainted by some part of the manufacturing process.

Another important question: Which has fewer nanoplastics and chemical residues, bottled or tap water?

“Several studies have reported lower microplastic levels in tap water. Hence, it’s plausible to expect lower nanoplastic levels in tap water as well, considering their common sources,” Yan said. “We’re conducting research on that right now.”

What happens once the plastic polymer and the endocrine-disrupting chemicals enter the body’s cells? Do the invaders remain, wreaking havoc by disrupting or damaging cellular processes, or does the body succeed in kicking them out?

“We know these microparticles are getting into the body, and we know even greater percentages of the smaller nanoparticles are getting into cells, but we don’t know exactly where they’re going in the cell or what they are doing,” Stapleton said. “And we don’t know if or how they’re getting back out again.”

However, the new technology is well-suited to analyzing human tissue samples and should soon provide some answers, Min said.

“If you look at our raw data, it’s actually a series of images,” Min said. “In fact, we have plenty of data to show if a particle has entered a particular location in a certain type of cell, then we will be able to locate it precisely in space.”

While science explores these and other questions, there are things people can do to reduce their exposure to plastics, said Healthy Babies, Bright Futures’ Houlihan.

“We can avoid consuming foods and beverages in plastic containers. We can wear clothing made from natural fabrics and buy consumer products made from natural materials,” Houlihan said. “We can simply take stock of the plastic in our daily lives and find alternatives whenever feasible.”",https://edition.cnn.com
84,"After vetoing three prior UN resolutions on Gaza, US sees its own ceasefire proposal rejected","CNN —

A United Nations Security Council resolution proposed by the United States calling for a ceasefire tied to the release of hostages in Gaza failed to pass on Friday, after Russia and China vetoed the draft.

The rejected draft resolution called for “an immediate and sustained ceasefire… in connection with the release of all remaining hostages.” Washington had previously vetoed three prior UN resolutions calling for a ceasefire.

The UN vote came amid resumed hostage talks in Qatar on Friday, and as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an intensive diplomatic push toward a ceasefire.

The US, Israel’s most prominent defender on the world stage, has faced severe criticism in Arab countries and in Europe for its refusal to call for a ceasefire early in the Gaza war as well as its reluctance to translate its verbal criticism of Israel’s conduct to diplomatic action.

Eleven security council members voted for the resolution but permanent members Russia and China, who have veto power, blocked it. Israel Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said the Security Council’s decision “not to condemn Hamas is a stain that will never be forgotten.”

Meanwhile, Algeria – which also rejected the resolution – said the submitted text “was not a clear message of peace, and would have allowed for more Palestinian civilians to be killed.” The US had previously rejected a ceasefire resolution put forth by Algeria.

With the draft resolution, Washington was seeking to recover from international criticism of its support for Israel, experts say.

The resolution included phrasing that the US was unwilling to use before, said Frank Lowenstein, who worked as US Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations under US President Barack Obama during the 2014 Israel-Gaza war. This referred to an “immediate ceasefire,” which the former diplomat said was likely a bid to bring the US back from months of international “isolation.”

“It gets the US back in line with the international community so we’re not as isolated as we’ve been in vetoing,” he said.

Lowenstein said that Russia and China’s veto was “a blatant effort” to keep the US isolated. “They (Russia and China) are playing politics with the ceasefire, clearly putting their desire to isolate the US internationally ahead of the interests of the Palestinians in Gaza who desperately need a ceasefire,” he said.

The US struck down a draft resolution on October 18 that called for “humanitarian pauses,” which US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield vetoed as it “did not mention Israel’s right of self-defense.”

The US vetoed a second UN resolution on December 8, rejecting a version put forth by the United Arab Emirates that called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” as well as “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” and “ensuring humanitarian access.”

More recently, US vetoed an Algerian resolution on February 20 that called for an immediate ceasefire, which Thomas-Greenfield said “would put sensitive negotiations in jeopardy.”

Washington’s attitude toward Israel’s war policies gradually changed, however, amid mounting death tolls in Gaza and growing opposition to what American and international observers perceived as the Biden administration’s inability to reign in its Israeli ally.

US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this month traded barbs in interviews over Israel’s war, and especially about Israel’s planned incursion into Rafah.

The US even sanctioned Israeli settlers in the West Bank, and Biden publicly praised a speech by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that called for new Israeli elections that would replace Netanyahu.

“I think there has been a gap from day one, a gap between the language and the actions,” said Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London.

“But I think gradually, the language and the action are coming closer, closing the gap, millimeter by millimeter.”

If the US resolution had passed, it would have been “the end of giving Israel the carte blanche to do whatever they like,” he said, speaking to CNN before Friday’s vote. “The (strain in) relations between the two countries is unprecedented.”

Lowenstein said the resolution is “a strong signal” to Israel there are consequences to defying the US on its requests for humanitarian aid and against a Rafah incursion. It also meant to get all parties to agree on a ceasefire-hostage deal, particularly Hamas, he told CNN.",https://edition.cnn.com
85,"Cillian Murphy returning for ‘Peaky Blinders’ movie, creator says","CNN —

Fresh off of his Oscar win for best actor, it looks like Cillian Murphy hasn’t forgotten where he came from.

Steven Knight, creator of the beloved crime drama “Peaky Blinders,” told Birmingham World Murphy is set to reprise his role as gang leader Tommy Shelby in the planned “Peaky Blinders” movie.

“He definitely is returning for it,” Knight told the publication. “We’re shooting it in September just down the road in Digbeth.”

CNN has reached out to representatives for Murphy for comment.

The actor was the darling of this most recent awards season for his portrayal of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in the Christopher Nolan film “Oppenheimer.”

Fans of “Peaky Blinders” had expressed interest on social media as to whether Murphy would return to the role given his great success with “Oppenheimer.”",https://edition.cnn.com
86,Courtney Love is a punk princess at London’s National Portrait Gallery,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.

CNN —

On Tuesday, a starry guestlist poured into the regal halls of London’s National Portrait Gallery for the museum’s first fundraising Gala since its hefty three-year remodel completed in 2023. Against the backdrop of 1700s portraiture, former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, artist Tracey Emin and Dame Kristen Scott Thomas (now a Miu Miu catwalk model as well as a BAFTA Award-winning actor) were snapped in their frocks and tuxedos, adhering to a dress code of “glamour.”

With many attendees from the upper echelons of the British creative scene choosing to champion homegrown labels — Alexa Chung wore Erdem, TV presenter Maya Jama opted for a satin, off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood number — one could imagine a born-and-bred Californian could feel daunted. But Hole singer Courtney Love certainly got the memo. Straying from the London Fashion Week mainstays, Love instead chose to revive a name from fashion history — and arrived in the biggest (and arguably the best) gown of the evening.

Dressed in a waterfall of gray silk duchess satin and black tulle, Love was the punk princess of St. Martin’s Place. And it was no wonder, considering the 18th-century inspired gown was the work of Elizabeth Emanuel, Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer.

The custom look was a variation on Emanuel’s “Marie Antoinette” frock which Love had spotted in last month’s copy of British high-society gossip magazine, Tatler. Originally designed in pale pink, Love’s version was fashioned out of a darker palette for more drama. Emanuel added crystal appliques at the waist, while the corset itself was boned and fastened with black lacing. Most captivating of all, perhaps, was the bustle skirt silhouette, hand-draped by Emanuel. “The effect was very grown up (yet) ‘Princess’ like,” she told CNN via email.

Dress designer Emanuel rose to fame when she received the commission of a lifetime in 1981. The gown she created for Princess Diana’s wedding to Prince Charles — a pearl-embellished, ivory taffeta dress complete with ‘80s puff sleeves and a 25-foot train — has since gone down in history as one of the most iconic moments in fashion. In June 2021, 40 years after it was worn down the aisle, the dress was exhibited at Diana’s former home in Kensington Palace.

Later in the evening, Love is photographed stepping behind the decks to DJ. An outstretched arm shows a torn tulle sleeve — snagged presumably while she was lost in the music. The mark of a true people’s princess.",https://edition.cnn.com

Excepto lo que se especifica en la Sección 12 (Resolución de Disputas), si alguna disposición de este Acuerdo fuera ilegal, nula o por cualquier razón inejecutable, entonces esa disposición se considerará divisible para este Acuerdo y no afectará la validez y ejecución de ninguna de las restantes disposición. Este es el acuerdo completo entre las partes en relación con los asuntos contenidos en este documento.

Resolución de Disputas

Nos esforzamos por resolver las inquietudes de los clientes tan rápido como sea posible. Por favor contacte a CNN en cnn.com/feedback.

En el improbable caso de que usted no esté satisfecho con la solución del servicio de atención al cliente, y que usted y CNN no puedan resolver una disputa a través de los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas descriptos a continuación, usted y CNN aceptan resolver la disputa a través de un arbitraje vinculante o en una corte de reclamos menores en lugar de las cortes de jurisdicción general.

El arbitraje es una instancia más informal que un juicio en una corte. El arbitraje recurre a un árbitro imparcial en lugar de un juez o jurado, permite un periodo de instrucción más breve que en una corte y está sujeto a una revisión muy limitada por parte de las cortes. A menos que esté expresamente limitado por esta cláusula de arbitraje, los árbitros pueden otorgar los mismos daños y reparación que puede otorgar una corte. Cualquier arbitraje en virtud de este Acuerdo se llevará a cabo de forma individual; no se permiten los arbitrajes colectivos ni las demandas colectivas. En el arbitraje, usted puede tener derecho a recuperar de CNN los honorarios de sus abogados en la misma medida en que usted tendría derecho a hacerlo en una corte.

CLÁUSULA DE ARBITRAJE

(1) Reclamos sujetos a arbitraje: En la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable, CNN y usted aceptan arbitrar todas las disputas y reclamos que surjan entre nosotros, excepto los reclamos que surjan de lesiones corporales o que se relacionen con el cumplimiento, la protección o la validez de sus derechos de propiedad intelectual o de los nuestros (o los derechos de propiedad intelectual de cualquiera de nuestros licenciantes, afiliados y socios). Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje debe ser interpretada en sentido amplio. La cláusula incluye, pero no se limita a:

reclamos que surjan de o se relacionen con cualquier aspecto de la relación entre nosotros, ya sea que se basen en disposiciones contractuales, actos ilícitos civiles, fraude, tergiversación o cualquier otra figura legal estatutaria o de derecho consuetudinario;

reclamos que surgieron antes de este o cualquier otro Acuerdo anterior (incluido, entre otros, reclamos relacionados con publicidad);

reclamos por angustia mental o emocional, o lesiones que no surjan de una lesión corporal;

reclamos que actualmente son objeto de un pretendido litigio colectivo en el que usted no es miembro de una clase certificada; y

reclamos que puedan surgir después de la rescisión de este Acuerdo.

Las referencias a ""CNN"", ""usted"", ""nosotros"" y ""nuestro"" en esta Cláusula de Arbitraje incluyen a nuestros respectivos predecesores en intereses, sucesores y cesionarios, así como a nuestras respectivas empresas matrices, subsidiarias y afiliadas, pasadas, presentes y futuras (incluidos Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. y sus afiliadas); esas entidades y nuestros respectivos agentes, empleados, licenciatarios, licenciantes y proveedores de contenido en el momento en que surja su reclamo o el nuestro; y todos los usuarios o beneficiarios autorizados o no autorizados de Servicios en virtud de este o anteriores Acuerdos entre nosotros. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, cualquiera de las partes puede optar por que los reclamos se resuelvan en una corte de reclamos menores solicitando solo una reparación individual, siempre que la acción no sea trasladada o apelada a una corte de jurisdicción general. Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje no le impide a usted presentar cuestiones a las agencias federales, estatales o locales. Usted acepta que, al celebrar el presente Acuerdo, tanto usted como nosotros renunciamos al derecho a participar en una demanda colectiva y a un juicio por jurado en la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable. Este Acuerdo evidencia una transacción en el comercio interestatal y, por lo tanto, la Ley Federal de Arbitraje (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) rige la interpretación y el cumplimiento de esta cláusula de arbitraje. Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje sobrevivirá la rescisión de este Acuerdo.

(2) Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas: Usted y nosotros acordamos que los esfuerzos informales y de buena fe para resolver disputas a menudo pueden resultar en un resultado rápido, económico y mutuamente beneficioso. Por lo tanto, la parte que tenga la intención de iniciar un arbitraje o presentar un reclamo en una corte de reclamos menores primero debe enviar por escrito a la otra parte una Notificación de Disputa (""Notificación""). Una Notificación de usted a CNN debe ser enviada por correo electrónico a notice@wbd.com (“Dirección de Notificación”). Cualquier Notificación debe incluir (i) el nombre del reclamante, su dirección y dirección de correo electrónico; (ii) una descripción de la naturaleza y los fundamentos del reclamo o disputa; (iii) si usted presenta la Notificación, cualquier hecho relevante con respecto a su uso de los Sitios, incluido si ha creado una cuenta o si recibe boletines asociados con cualquiera de los Sitios; (iv) una descripción de la naturaleza y fundamento de la reparación específica solicitada, incluidos los daños reclamados, si los hubiere, y un cálculo detallado de éstos; y (v) una declaración firmada personalmente por el reclamante (no por su abogado) que verifique la exactitud del contenido de la Notificación. La Notificación debe ser individualizada, lo que significa que solo puede referirse a su disputa y no a la disputa de otra persona.

Después de recibir una Notificación completa, las partes deberán realizar un esfuerzo de buena fe para resolver la disputa por un período de 60 días (que puede extenderse por acuerdo). Usted y nosotros acordamos que, después de recibir la Notificación completa, el destinatario puede solicitar una conferencia de conciliación telefónica o por video (que se puede realizar después del período de 60 días) y ambas partes asistirán personalmente (con un abogado, si están representadas). Usted y nosotros acordamos que las partes (y los abogados, si están representadas) deberán trabajar cooperativamente para programar la conferencia lo antes posible en cuanto sea conveniente para ambas partes y tratar de llegar a una resolución. Si usted y nosotros no llegamos a un acuerdo para resolver las cuestiones identificadas en la Notificación dentro de los 60 días posteriores a la recepción de la Notificación completa (o en un plazo mayor si las partes así lo acuerdan), usted o nosotros podremos iniciar un procedimiento de arbitraje o un proceso judicial de reclamos menores (si lo permiten las reglas de la corte de reclamos menores).

El cumplimiento de esta sección de Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas es una condición previa para iniciar el arbitraje. Cualquier período de prescripción aplicable (incluidos los periodos de prescripción conforme a la ley) y los plazos para pagar las tarifas de presentación se interrumpirán mientras las partes participan en los procedimientos informales de resolución de disputas establecidos en la Subsección 12.2. Tanto la Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje como los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas son esenciales para que usted y CNN tengan una oportunidad significativa de resolver disputas de manera informal. Si algún aspecto de estos requisitos no se ha cumplido, una corte competente puede prohibir la presentación o continuación de un arbitraje. Asimismo, a menos que lo prohíba la ley, el administrador del arbitraje no puede aceptar, administrar, evaluar o exigir tarifas en relación con un arbitraje que fue iniciado sin haber completado la Notificación y los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas. Si el arbitraje ya se encuentra pendiente, se procederá a su cierre administrativo. Nada en este párrafo limita el derecho de una parte a reclamar en el arbitraje daños y perjuicios por incumplimiento de estos Procedimientos.

(3) Procedimiento de Arbitraje: El arbitraje se regirá por las reglas aplicables de Arbitraje y Mediación Nacional (“NAM”) (incluidas las Reglas y Procedimientos Integrales de Resolución de Disputas y/o las Reglas Complementarias para Presentaciones de Arbitraje Masivo , según corresponda) (""Reglas NAM""), modificadas por esta Cláusula de Arbitraje, y será administrado por NAM. (Si NAM no está disponible o no está dispuesto a hacerlo, otro proveedor de arbitrajes será seleccionado por las partes, o si las partes no pueden ponerse de acuerdo sobre un administrador alternativo, por la corte de conformidad con 9 U.S.C. § 5). Las Reglas NAM están disponibles en línea en http://www.NAMADR.org, llamando a NAM al 1-800-358-2550, o solicitándolas por escrito a la Dirección de Notificación (disponibles en inglés únicamente). Puede obtener un formulario para iniciar el arbitraje en: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf (disponibles en inglés únicamente) o comunicándose con NAM.

Usted y nosotros acordamos que la parte que inicia el arbitraje debe presentar una certificación de que ha cumplido y completado los requisitos de Notificación y Resolución Informal de Disputas a los que se hace referencia en la sección 12.2 y que son parte de la Cláusula de Arbitraje incluida o adjunta a la solicitud de arbitraje. La solicitud de arbitraje y certificación debe estar firmada personalmente por la parte que inicia el arbitraje (y su abogado, si está representada).

Todas las cuestiones serán decididas por el árbitro, excepto que se indique expresamente lo contrario aquí y exceptuando las cuestiones relacionadas con el alcance y la exigibilidad de la Cláusula de Arbitraje o si una disputa puede o debe someterse a arbitraje (incluyendo si una disputa está sujeta a esta Cláusula de Arbitraje o a una cláusula de arbitraje previa entre usted y CNN), las cuales serán decididas por una corte competente. El árbitro puede considerar, pero no estará obligado por las decisiones de otros arbitrajes que involucren a diferentes clientes.

A menos que usted y nosotros acordemos lo contrario, o las Reglas NAM aplicables expresen lo contrario, las audiencias de arbitraje se llevarán a cabo en el condado (o parroquia) de su dirección de facturación y usted y un representante de CNN deberán asistir en persona. Al concluir el procedimiento de arbitraje, el árbitro emitirá una decisión por escrito razonada que sea suficiente para explicar los hallazgos y conclusiones esenciales en los que se basa el laudo. La decisión del árbitro es vinculante solo entre usted y CNN, y no tendrá ningún efecto preclusivo en otro arbitraje o procedimiento que involucre a una parte diferente. El laudo de un árbitro que se haya cumplido por completo no se presentará en ninguna corte.

Al igual que ante una corte, usted y CNN acuerdan que cualquier abogado que represente a una parte en el arbitraje certifique al momento de comenzar y proceder un arbitraje que está cumpliendo con los requisitos de la Norma Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11(b), incluida la certificación de que el reclamo o la reparación que se busca no es frívola ni presentada para un propósito inapropiado. El árbitro está autorizado a imponer cualquier sanción bajo las Reglas NAM, la Regla Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11 o la ley federal o estatal aplicable, contra todas las partes representadas y los abogados correspondientes.

Salvo que se disponga expresamente en la Cláusula de Arbitraje, el árbitro puede otorgar cualquier remedio, compensación o resultado que las partes podrían haber recibido en una corte, incluida la compensación por honorarios y costos de abogados, de conformidad con la ley aplicable. A menos que la ley aplicable disponga lo contrario, serán de cargo de las partes los honorarios y costos de sus propios abogados en el arbitraje, a menos que el árbitro dicte sanciones o determine que el fondo de la demanda, la defensa o la reparación solicitada son frívolos o presentados para un propósito inapropiado (medido conforme a los estándares establecidos en la Regla Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11(b)).

(4) Tarifas del Arbitraje: El pago de las tarifas del arbitraje (las tarifas impuestas por el administrador del arbitraje, incluyendo las tarifas de presentación, árbitro y audiencia) se regirá por las Reglas NAM aplicables, a menos que usted califique para una exención de las tarifas según la ley aplicable. Si después de agotar cualquier exención de tarifas potencialmente disponible, el árbitro determina que las tarifas de arbitraje serán prohibitivas para usted en comparación con un litigio judicial, pagaremos el monto de sus tarifas de presentación, arbitraje y audiencia en el arbitraje que el árbitro considere necesario para evitar que el arbitraje tenga un costo prohibitivo, independientemente del resultado del arbitraje, a menos que el árbitro determine que su(s) reclamo(s) fue(ron) frívolo(s) o presentado(s) para un propósito inapropiado o presentados de mala fe. Usted y nosotros acordamos que el arbitraje debe ser económicamente eficiente para todas las partes y que cualquiera de las partes puede recurrir a NAM para abordar la reducción o el aplazamiento de las tarifas.

(5) Confidencialidad: A solicitud de cualquiera de las partes, el árbitro emitirá una orden exigiendo que la información confidencial de cualquiera de las partes divulgada durante el arbitraje (ya sea en documentos u oralmente) no se use ni divulgue excepto en relación con el arbitraje o con un procedimiento para hacer cumplir el laudo arbitral y que cualquier presentación judicial permitida que contenga información confidencial debe hacerse en sobre sellado en la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable.

(6) Oferta de Transacción: En cualquier arbitraje entre usted y CNN, la parte demandada puede, pero no está obligada, a hacer una oferta de transacción por escrito en cualquier momento antes de la audiencia probatoria o, si se permite una excepción preliminar, antes de que se acoja la excepción preliminar. El monto o los términos de cualquier oferta de transacción no se pueden divulgar al árbitro hasta después de que el árbitro emita un laudo sobre el reclamo. Si el laudo se emite a favor de la otra parte y es menor que la oferta de transacción de la parte demandada o si el laudo es a favor de la parte demandada, la otra parte debe pagar los costos incurridos por la parte demandada después de que se hizo la oferta, incluidos los honorarios de los abogados. Si alguna ley o jurisprudencia aplicable prohíbe el traslado de los costos incurridos en el arbitraje, entonces la oferta en esta disposición servirá para cesar la acumulación de los costos a los que la parte que presenta la demanda pueda tener derecho por el fundamento de la acción en virtud de la cual está demandando.

(7) Requisito de Reparación Individual: el árbitro puede otorgar una reparación declaratoria o cautelar solo a favor de la parte individual que busca la reparación y solo en la medida necesaria para proporcionar la reparación justificada por el reclamo individual de esa parte. EN LA MEDIDA MÁXIMA QUE LO PERMITA LA LEY APLICABLE, USTED Y NOSOTROS ACORDAMOS QUE CADA UNO PUEDE PRESENTAR RECLAMACIONES EN CONTRA DEL OTRO ÚNICAMENTE EN CARACTER INDIVIDUAL, Y NO COMO DEMANDANTE O MIEMBRO DE UNA CLASE EN UN PRETENDIDO PROCEDIMIENTO COLECTIVO, REPRESENTATIVO, O DE PROCURADOR GENERAL PRIVADO. Asimismo, a menos que tanto usted como nosotros acordemos lo contrario, el árbitro no puede consolidar las reclamaciones de más de una persona y no puede presidir ninguna forma de procedimiento representativo, colectivo o de procurador general privado. Si, después del agotamiento de todos los recursos, alguna de estas prohibiciones relativas a medidas cautelares o declaratorias no individualizadas; reclamos colectivos, representativos y de procurador general privado; y consolidación, se resuelve que no es ejecutable con respecto a un reclamo en particular o con respecto a una solicitud de reparación en particular (como una solicitud de medida cautelar solicitada con respecto a un reclamo en particular), entonces las partes acuerdan que tal reclamo o solicitud de reparación será decidido por una corte competente, después de que se hayan arbitrado todas las demás reclamaciones arbitrables y solicitudes de reparación. Usted acepta que cualquier arbitraje entre usted y CNN estará sujeto a esta Sección 12 y no a acuerdo(s) de arbitraje previo(s) que haya tenido con CNN y, sin perjuicio de cualquier disposición en contrario en este Acuerdo, usted acepta que esta Sección 12 modifica cualquier acuerdo de arbitraje previo que tuvo con CNN, incluso con respecto a reclamos que surgieron antes de este o cualquier acuerdo de arbitraje anterior.

(8) Exclusión de Cambios Futuros: Sin perjuicio de cualquier disposición en contrario, si CNN realiza algún cambio en el futuro a esta Cláusula de Arbitraje (que no sea un cambio en la Dirección de Notificación), usted puede rechazar dicho cambio enviando un correo electrónico a CNN a notice@wbd.com dentro de los 30 días posteriores a la publicación de la cláusula de arbitraje modificada, que proporcione: (i) su nombre legal completo, (ii) su dirección postal completa, (iii) su número de teléfono, (iv) si corresponde, el nombre de usuario o la dirección de correo electrónico asociados con cualquier potencial cuenta o boletín; y (v) la fecha aproximada de su uso inicial del Sitio relevante. Dicho correo electrónico de exclusión debe ser enviado por usted personalmente, y no por su agente, abogado o cualquier otra persona que pretenda actuar en su nombre. Debe incluir una declaración, firmada personalmente por usted, de que desea rechazar el cambio a la Cláusula de Arbitraje. Esta no es una exclusión del arbitraje en su totalidad.

(9) Presentación Masiva:

Si, en cualquier momento, 25 o más demandantes (incluido usted) presentan Notificaciones o pretenden presentar solicitudes de arbitraje planteando reclamos similares contra la otra parte o partes relacionadas, por abogado(s) o entidad(es) iguales o coordinadas, de conformidad con la definición y los criterios de Presentaciones Masivas (""Presentación Masiva"") establecidos en las Reglas y Procedimientos Complementarios de Resolución de Disputas de Presentación Masiva de NAM (""Reglas de Presentación Masiva de NAM"", disponibles en https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/ (disponible en inglés únicamente)), usted y nosotros acordamos que se aplicarán los procedimientos adicionales establecidos a continuación. Las partes acuerdan que a lo largo de este proceso, sus abogados deberán reunirse y consultarse para discutir modificaciones a estos procedimientos en función de las necesidades particulares de la Presentación Masiva. Las partes reconocen y aceptan que al optar por participar en una Presentación Masiva, la resolución de su disputa podría retrasarse. Cualquier período de prescripción aplicable (incluido la prescripción conforme a la ley) y los plazos de las tarifas de presentación se suspenderán a partir del momento en que se inicie la Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas, siempre y cuando la Notificación previa al arbitraje cumpla con los requisitos de la Sección 12.2, y hasta que su reclamo sea seleccionado para continuar como parte de un proceso por etapas o se resuelva por acuerdo, se retire, sea resuelto de otro modo o se excluya del arbitraje.

Etapa Uno: Los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 25 reclamos por lado (50 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Cada uno de estos arbitrajes individuales se asignará a un único y diferente árbitro, a menos que las partes acuerden lo contrario por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que sean seleccionados para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que se complete este grupo inicial de procedimientos por etapas, las partes participarán prontamente en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado y CNN pagará los honorarios del mediador.

Etapa Dos: Si los reclamos restantes no se resuelven en este momento, los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 50 reclamos por lado (100 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un segundo proceso por etapas, sujeto a cualquier cambio procesal que las partes acuerden por escrito. Cada uno de estos arbitrajes individuales se asignará a un único y diferente árbitro, a menos que las partes acuerden lo contrario por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que se seleccionen para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que se complete este segundo conjunto de procedimientos por etapas, las partes participarán de inmediato en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado y CNN pagará los honorarios del mediador.

Etapa Tres: Si los reclamos restantes no se resuelven en este momento, los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 100 reclamos por parte (200 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un tercer proceso por etapas, sujeto a cualquier cambio procesal que las partes acuerden por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que se seleccionen para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de este tercer conjunto de procedimientos por etapas, los abogados de los demandantes pueden elegir que las partes participen en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado.

Si su reclamo no se resuelve como parte del proceso por etapas identificado anteriormente:

Opción Uno: Usted y CNN pueden por separado o por acuerdo, optar por la exclusión del arbitraje y elegir que su reclamo se presente en una corte de conformidad con el Acuerdo. Usted puede optar por la exclusión del arbitraje proporcionando una notificación, individual y firmada personalmente por usted, de su intención de optar por la exclusión del arbitraje, enviando un correo electrónico a CNN a notice@wbd.com. Dicho correo electrónico de exclusión debe ser enviado por usted personalmente, y no por su agente, abogado o cualquier otra persona que pretenda actuar en su nombre. Debe incluir una declaración firmada personalmente por usted de que desea optar por la exclusión del arbitraje dentro de los 30 días posteriores a la conclusión de la Etapa 3 o de la mediación electiva asociada con la Etapa 3. CNN puede excluir su reclamo de arbitraje enviando a su abogado una notificación individual, personalmente firmada, de su intención de excluirlo, dentro de los 14 días posteriores a la expiración de su período de 30 días para optar por la exclusión. Los abogados de las partes pueden acordar ajustar estos plazos.

O

Opción Dos: Si ni usted ni CNN eligen que su reclamo se escuche en una corte de acuerdo con la Opción Uno, entonces usted acepta que su reclamo se resolverá como parte de un procedimiento de arbitraje individual continuo y por etapas como se establece a continuación. Suponiendo que el número de reclamaciones restantes supere las 200, se seleccionarán al azar 200 reclamaciones (o se seleccionarán a través de un proceso acordado por los abogados de las partes) para presentarlas y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Si el número de reclamaciones restantes es inferior a 200, entonces todas esas reclamaciones se presentarán y procederán en arbitrajes individuales. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que sean seleccionados para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que cada conjunto de 200 reclamaciones se resuelva, arribe a un acuerdo, se retire o se resuelva de otra forma, este proceso se repetirá de acuerdo con estos parámetros. Se alienta a los abogados de las partes a que se reúnan y consulten, participen en la mediación y se comprometan entre sí y con NAM (incluso a través de un Árbitro Procesal) para explorar formas de simplificar la resolución de reclamos, aumentar la cantidad de reclamos para proceder en cualquier momento, promover la eficiencia, conservar los recursos y resolver las reclamaciones restantes.

Una corte competente tendrá la autoridad para ejecutar estas disposiciones de Presentación Masiva y, si es necesario, prohibir la presentación masiva, continuación o administración de arbitrajes, y la valuación de las tarifas de arbitraje. Si estos procedimientos adicionales aplican a su reclamo, y una corte competente determina que no son exigibles en cuanto a su reclamo, entonces su reclamo procederá en una corte competente de conformidad con este Acuerdo.

Usted y CNN acordamos que ambos valoramos la integridad y la eficiencia del arbitraje y deseamos emplear el proceso para la resolución justa de disputas genuinas y sinceras entre nosotros. Usted y CNN reconocen y aceptan actuar de buena fe para garantizar que se sigan los procesos establecidos en este documento. Las partes también acuerdan que la aplicación de estos procedimientos de Presentación Masiva ha sido razonablemente diseñada para dar como resultado una resolución eficiente y justa de tales casos.

(10) Separabilidad: Si se determina que alguna parte de esta Cláusula de Arbitraje es declarada nula, inválida o inejecutable de algún modo, dicha parte se considerará divisible y, si es posible, reemplazada por una disposición o parte válida y ejecutable, que coincida en lo más posible con la intención de la disposición original, o parte de ella. El resto de esta Cláusula de Arbitraje seguirá siendo ejecutable y válida de acuerdo con los términos contenidos en este documento.

RENUNCIA A DEMANDA COLECTIVA Y JUICIO CON JURADO:

Usted y CNN acuerdan que, en la máxima medida permitida por la ley, cada parte puede presentar reclamos (ya sea en una corte o en arbitraje) contra la otra solo a título individual y no participar como demandante, reclamante o miembro de la clase en cualquier procedimiento de clase, colectivo, consolidado, de procurador general privado o representativo. Esto significa que usted y CNN no pueden presentar un reclamo en nombre de una clase o grupo y no pueden presentar un reclamo en nombre de ninguna otra persona a menos que lo hagan como padre, tutor o guardián de un menor o en otra capacidad similar por un individuo que de otro modo no puede presentar su propio reclamo individual. Esto también significa que usted y CNN no pueden participar en ningún procedimiento de clase, colectivo, consolidado, de procurador general privado o representativo presentado por un tercero. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, usted o CNN pueden participar en un acuerdo transaccional colectivo.

En la máxima medida permitida por la ley, usted y CNN renuncian a cualquier derecho a un juicio con jurado.

88,"Última hora del ataque de ISIS en Moscú en vivo: reacciones, noticias y última hora","¿Qué pasó en Moscú? Lo que sabemos del ataque terrorista en el Crocus City Hall

Rusia ha quedado aturdida tras el peor ataque terrorista sufrido por el país en décadas.

El ISIS ha reivindicado la autoría de la masacre, en la que asaltantes armados irrumpieron en un popular complejo de salas de conciertos a las afueras de Moscú, matando a más de 130 personas.

Cerca de una decena de personas han sido detenidas en relación con la masacre, según las autoriades. Y cuatro de estas personas, provenientes de Tayikistán, han sido acusadas de terrorismo.

Esto es lo que sabemos.

¿Qué pasó en Rusia?

Atacantes con armas de fuego y dispositivos incendiarios abrieron fuego a mansalva en el complejo Crocus City, que alberga un popular salón de música y un centro comercial, el viernes por la noche.

La multitud seguía llegando, pero el auditorio ya estaba lleno de gente antes del concierto del grupo Picnic. Según los informes, se vendieron unas 6.500 entradas para el espectáculo. Pero en lugar de una noche bailando al ritmo del rock, se desarrolló un caos absoluto.

Testigos aterrorizados captaron en video el momento exacto en que hombres armados, vestidos con uniformes de camuflaje y portando armas automáticas, comenzaron a disparar indiscriminadamente. Las imágenes mostraban a los asistentes al concierto gritando y agachándose para cubrirse detrás de asientos acolchados mientras otros se apiñaban mientras los disparos resonaban en el vasto salón.

Durante el alboroto, un grupo que se refugiaba junto a una gran pared de ventanas fuera de la sala de conciertos se vio obligado a romperlas para escapar de los disparos, según muestra un video obtenido por CNN.

Un testigo anónimo que sobrevivió al ataque dijo que los hombres armados entraron a la sala de conciertos y “comenzaron a disparar a todos”.

“Estaba sentado en el pasillo de arriba, donde estaban los balcones. Oímos disparos. Al principio no entendíamos lo que había pasado”, dijo en una entrevista con Ostorozhno Novosti, publicada por Reuters. Agregó que los atacantes lanzaron una bomba molotov y luego “todo estaba prendido fuego”.

El manager de la banda dijo más tarde a los medios estatales que los intérpretes resultaron ilesos.

Un equipo SWAT fue llamado a la zona y más de 70 equipos de ambulancias y médicos ayudaron a las víctimas.

Los incendios seguían ardiendo en Crocus City el sábado y el techo del lugar se había derrumbado parcialmente. Casi 500 personas estaban trabajando para desmantelar los escombros en el lugar, dijo el Ministerio de Emergencias ruso.

(CNN) -- Rusia ha quedado aturdida tras el peor ataque terrorista sufrido por el país en décadas.

El ISIS ha reivindicado la autoría de la masacre, en la que asaltantes armados irrumpieron en un popular complejo de salas de conciertos a las afueras de Moscú, matando a más de 130 personas.

Cerca de una decena de personas han sido detenidas en relación con la masacre, según las autoriades. Y cuatro de estas personas, provenientes de Tayikistán, han sido acusadas de terrorismo.

Esto es lo que sabemos.

¿Qué pasó en Rusia?

Atacantes con armas de fuego y dispositivos incendiarios abrieron fuego a mansalva en el complejo Crocus City, que alberga un popular salón de música y un centro comercial, el viernes por la noche.

La multitud seguía llegando, pero el auditorio ya estaba lleno de gente antes del concierto del grupo Picnic. Según los informes, se vendieron unas 6.500 entradas para el espectáculo. Pero en lugar de una noche bailando al ritmo del rock, se desarrolló un caos absoluto.

Testigos aterrorizados captaron en video el momento exacto en que hombres armados, vestidos con uniformes de camuflaje y portando armas automáticas, comenzaron a disparar indiscriminadamente. Las imágenes mostraban a los asistentes al concierto gritando y agachándose para cubrirse detrás de asientos acolchados mientras otros se apiñaban mientras los disparos resonaban en el vasto salón.

Durante el alboroto, un grupo que se refugiaba junto a una gran pared de ventanas fuera de la sala de conciertos se vio obligado a romperlas para escapar de los disparos, según muestra un video obtenido por CNN.

Un testigo anónimo que sobrevivió al ataque dijo que los hombres armados entraron a la sala de conciertos y “comenzaron a disparar a todos”.

“Estaba sentado en el pasillo de arriba, donde estaban los balcones. Oímos disparos. Al principio no entendíamos lo que había pasado”, dijo en una entrevista con Ostorozhno Novosti, publicada por Reuters. Agregó que los atacantes lanzaron una bomba molotov y luego “todo estaba prendido fuego”.

El manager de la banda dijo más tarde a los medios estatales que los intérpretes resultaron ilesos.

Un equipo SWAT fue llamado a la zona y más de 70 equipos de ambulancias y médicos ayudaron a las víctimas.

Los incendios seguían ardiendo en Crocus City el sábado y el techo del lugar se había derrumbado parcialmente. Casi 500 personas estaban trabajando para desmantelar los escombros en el lugar, dijo el Ministerio de Emergencias ruso.

¿Cuántos han resultado heridos?

Se sabe que al menos 137 personas han muerto en el vasto complejo, según la última actualización del Comité de Investigación de Rusia del sábado. Las autoridades dicen que es probable que ese número siga aumentando a medida que los servicios de emergencia trabajan en la escena.

Además, más de 100 personas resultaron heridas en el incidente, muchas de ellas en estado grave, incluidos dos niños.

El gobernador de la región de Moscú, Andrey Vorobyov, dijo el sábado que las víctimas del ataque terrorista recibirán una compensación financiera de los gobiernos de la región y de la ciudad.

Los familiares de cada uno de los fallecidos recibirían tres millones de rublos (US$ 32.500), mientras que los heridos y hospitalizados recibirían un millón de rublos (US$ 10.840).

“Los niños registrados en la región de Moscú cuyo padre o madre murieron en la tragedia también recibirán pagos mensuales. Además, compensaremos a todos por los gastos de entierro y resolveremos todas las cuestiones jurídicas”, añadió Voróbiov.

¿Quién estuvo detrás del ataque en el Crocus City Hall?

El Estado Islámico (ISIS) se atribuyó la responsabilidad del ataque en una breve declaración publicada por la agencia de noticias Amaq, afiliada a ISIS, en Telegram el viernes.

Al día siguiente, el grupo terrorista publicó una imagen a través de Amaq que pretendía mostrar a los cuatro hombres que habían atacado el complejo. Ninguno de los hombres era identificable en la imagen; Todos llevaban pasamontañas y el resto de sus rostros están difuminados.

ISIS describió el ataque como “el más feroz en años”, según una traducción del mensaje del SITE Intelligence Group, que monitorea la propaganda de los grupos terroristas.

Amaq también proporcionó detalles del ataque, diciendo que tres combatientes atacaron a la multitud reunida en el lugar con pistolas y cuchillos, mientras que el cuarto arrojó artefactos incendiarios. Dijo que el ataque fue precedido por una intensa operación de vigilancia del lugar.

Añadió que “el ataque se produce dentro del contexto normal de la guerra furiosa entre el Estado Islámico y los países que luchan contra el Islam”, según la traducción de SITE.

El sábado Amaq publicó un video explícito que pretende mostrar el ataque grabado por uno de los atacantes, sugiriendo que los perpetradores tenían un vínculo directo con ISIS para poder enviar el video.

El video, que dura unos 90 segundos, muestra a cuatro atacantes con los rostros borrosos y las voces distorsionadas en lo que parece ser el complejo del Crocus City Hall. Se pueden ver cuerpos y sangre en el suelo, mientras el fuego arde a lo lejos. El video también muestra a uno de los atacantes degollando a un hombre que yacía boca arriba.

CNN lo ha geolocalizado en la sala de conciertos y observa que sus metadatos de identificación han sido borrados.

Estados Unidos había advertido previamente a Moscú que los combatientes de ISIS estaban decididos a atacar a Rusia en los días previos a que los atacantes irrumpieran en la sala de conciertos.

A principios de este mes, la embajada de Estados Unidos en Rusia había dicho que estaba “siguiendo informes de que los extremistas tienen planes inminentes de atacar grandes reuniones en Moscú”, incluidos conciertos, y advirtió a los ciudadanos estadounidenses que evitaran esos lugares.

La portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de Estados Unidos, Adrienne Watson, dijo que el gobierno estadounidense había ""compartido esta información con las autoridades rusas de acuerdo con su antigua política de 'deber de advertir'"".

Pero en un discurso el martes, Putin criticó las advertencias estadounidenses como ""provocativas"" y dijo que ""estas acciones se parecen a un chantaje absoluto y a la intención de intimidar y desestabilizar nuestra sociedad"".

Los expertos dijeron que la magnitud de la matanza sería profundamente vergonzosa para el líder ruso, que había defendido un mensaje de seguridad nacional apenas una semana antes al ganar las elecciones manipuladas del país.

Según la agencia estatal RIA Novosti, en el último mes, Rusia ha frustrado varios incidentes relacionados con ISIS sólo en marzo.

Según RIA, se han reportado al menos cuatro incidentes en toda Rusia que, según las autoridades locales, involucraron a personas relacionadas con ISIS.

¿Quiénes son los principales sospechosos?

Cuatro hombres de la ex república soviética de Tayikistán han ingresado en prisión preventiva hasta el 22 de mayo tras comparecer el domingo ante un tribunal de Moscú acusados de perpetrar el atentado terrorista, según las autoridades rusas y los medios de comunicación estatales.

Los cuatro, de entre 20 y 30 años, fueron nombrados como Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni y Mukhammadsobir Faizov por los tribunales de la ciudad de Moscú en Telegram.

Tres de los hombres se declararon culpables de cometer un acto terrorista durante las vistas a puerta cerrada, según los tribunales de Moscú y la agencia de noticias estatal TASS. Los cuatro se enfrentan a una posible cadena perpetua.

Las imágenes de la sala del tribunal mostraban a los sospechosos con la cara magullada, incluido un hombre que llevaba un vendaje en el lado derecho de la cabeza. Otro sospechoso parecía no responder en una silla de ruedas y fue acompañado por un médico a la corte, un video de la Corte de la ciudad de Moscú en Telegram mostró.

El Kremlin dijo anteriormente que cuatro personas que se creía que estaban directamente involucradas en el ataque habían sido detenidas cuando intentaban cruzar la frontera con Ucrania, según TASS y otros medios de comunicación estatales.

RIA publicó más tarde la supuesta confesión de uno de los hombres en Telegram. En un breve video, un hombre con la cabeza ensangrentada y vendada habla en un ruso entrecortado. Dice su nombre y que tiene 30 años. Cuando se le pregunta dónde se dejaron las armas del atentado, responde: ""No conozco la ciudad, pregunta a mis amigos, ellos lo saben"".

CNN no puede verificar de forma independiente la veracidad del informe de RIA Novosti ni las declaraciones del presunto atacante, que podrían haber sido realizadas bajo coacción.

RIA también publicó imágenes de tres de los presuntos atacantes tras su detención, que coinciden con vídeos subidos a canales no oficiales a primera hora del sábado en los que se ve a los hombres siendo detenidos en la región suroccidental de Bryansk.

RIA dijo que uno de los presuntos atacantes había mencionado su regreso a Rusia desde Turquía a principios de este mes.

También informó de que el grupo vivía junto en un albergue en el norte de Moscú y que al menos dos de los cuatro autores se conocieron hace sólo ""10-12 días"". El coche que condujeron hasta el Ayuntamiento de Crocus y que luego utilizaron para huir había sido comprado a través de una conexión familiar.

Anteriormente, los medios de comunicación estatales rusos habían informado de que el jefe del Servicio de Seguridad ruso, Alexander Bortnikov, había comunicado al dirigente ruso que 11 personas habían sido detenidas en relación con el atentado.

¿Qué más dice Rusia?

Putin expresó su más sentido pésame tras el tiroteo, describiéndolo como un “acto sangriento y bárbaro” en un comunicado en video publicado el sábado.

El mandatario mostró su gratitud a los trabajadores de los servicios de emergencia que ""hicieron todo lo posible para salvar la vida de las personas, para sacarlas del fuego, del epicentro del fuego y el humo"", y dijo que las agencias estaban trabajando para establecer los detalles de la masacre.

Anteriormente, los medios estatales rusos informaron que el jefe del Servicio de Seguridad, Alexander Bortnikov, había dicho al líder ruso que 11 personas habían sido detenidas en relación con el ataque.

El Kremlin ha dicho que cuatro personas que se cree que están directamente involucradas en el ataque fueron arrestadas mientras intentaban cruzar la frontera hacia Ucrania, según TASS y otros medios de comunicación estatales.

Posteriormente, RIA publicó en Telegram la supuesta confesión de uno de los hombres. En un breve video, un hombre con la cabeza vendada y ensangrentada habla en ruso entrecortado. Da su nombre y su edad, 30 años. Cuando se le pregunta dónde dejaron las armas del ataque, responde: “No conozco la ciudad, pregúntale a mis amigos, ellos la saben”.

CNN no puede verificar de forma independiente la veracidad del informe de RIA Novosti ni de las declaraciones del presunto atacante, que pueden haber sido hechas bajo coacción.

RIA también publicó imágenes de tres de los presuntos atacantes después de ser detenidos, imágenes que coinciden con videos subidos a canales no oficiales el sábado temprano que muestran a los hombres siendo detenidos en la región suroeste de Bryansk.

En los medios estatales rusos no se ha publicado ninguna imagen ni video del cuarto presunto atacante.

RIA dijo que uno de los presuntos atacantes había mencionado su regreso a Rusia desde Turquía a principios de este mes.

También informó que el grupo vivía juntos en un albergue en el norte de Moscú y que al menos dos de los cuatro perpetradores se conocieron sólo “hace 10 o 12 días”. El coche que condujeron hasta el Ayuntamiento de Crocus y luego utilizaron para escapar había sido comprado a través de un familiar.

Putin también pareció culpar a Ucrania por el ataque mortal en su mensaje de video del sábado, cuando afirmó que se había preparado una “ventana” para que los atacantes escaparan a Ucrania.

La portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores ruso, María Zakharova, dijo en Telegram: ""Ahora sabemos en qué país planeaban esconderse estos malditos bastardos de la persecución: Ucrania"".

Ucrania negó enérgicamente cualquier participación. El Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Ucrania dijo el viernes: “Consideramos que tales acusaciones son una provocación planificada por el Kremlin para alimentar aún más la histeria antiucraniana en la sociedad rusa, crear condiciones para una mayor movilización de los ciudadanos rusos para participar en la agresión criminal contra nuestro país y desacreditar Ucrania a los ojos de la comunidad internacional”.

El Servicio de Inteligencia de Defensa de Ucrania afirmó el viernes, sin aportar pruebas, que el ataque fue planeado por los servicios especiales rusos para justificar un aumento de los ataques contra Ucrania.

Las razones detrás del ataque de ISIS a Rusia 4:38

¿Cuál ha sido la respuesta internacional?

La condena del ataque por parte de los líderes mundiales no se hizo esperar. El secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Antony Blinken, dijo el sábado que Estados Unidos condenó “enérgicamente” la masacre y al mismo tiempo transmitió su “más sentido pésame a las familias y seres queridos de los asesinados y a todos los afectados por este crimen atroz”.

Hubo sentimientos similares del secretario de Asuntos Exteriores británico, David Cameron, en nombre del Reino Unido, y del canciller alemán, Olaf Scholz, quien transmitió que los “pensamientos de su nación están con las familias de todas las víctimas y todos los heridos”.

El primer ministro polaco, Donald Tusk, dijo en una publicación en X que su país espera que el ataque no se convierta en “un pretexto para que nadie intensifique la violencia y la agresión”. Mientras tanto, el presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron, expresó su solidaridad con todos los rusos, mientras que el primer ministro indio, Narendra Modi y el príncipe heredero de Arabia Saudita, Mohammed bin Salman, también denunciaron el ataque.

El líder chino, Xi Jinping, ofreció sus condolencias a Putin el sábado “por el grave ataque terrorista que causó numerosas víctimas”, según un informe de los medios estatales chinos.

Mientras tanto, el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas lo calificó de ataque “atroz y cobarde”, mientras el secretario general Antonio Guterres condenó el incidente “en los términos más enérgicos posibles”.

90,Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU aprueba resolución que pide alto el fuego en Gaza,"La ONU aprueba resolución que pide alto el fuego inmediato en Gaza 4:03

(CNN) -- Las tensiones entre Estados Unidos e Israel quedaron al descubierto este lunes, cuando Washington se mantuvo al margen y permitió que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU aprobara una resolución que pedía un alto el fuego inmediato en Gaza.

La decisión de Estados Unidos de abstenerse en la votación llevó al primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, a cancelar un viaje previsto a EE.UU. de dos de sus principales asesores, según informaron dos funcionarios israelíes.

Estados Unidos había vetado anteriormente resoluciones similares que pedían un alto el fuego. Su postura evolucionó la semana pasada, cuando el viernes presentó una resolución de alto el fuego vinculada a la liberación de rehenes. Dicha resolución cayó al ser vetada por Rusia y China. La abstención estadounidense en la votación de este lunes permitió que se aprobara la última resolución, cuando los otros 14 miembros del Consejo de 15 miembros votaron a favor.

La embajadora estadounidense ante las Naciones Unidas, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, declaró que, aunque la última resolución incluía modificaciones solicitadas por Estados Unidos, Washington no podía votar sí porque ""no estaba de acuerdo con todo"".

La resolución, presentada por los 10 miembros no permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad, exige un alto el fuego inmediato durante el mes de Ramadán, la liberación inmediata e incondicional de los rehenes y ""la urgente necesidad de ampliar el flujo"" de ayuda a Gaza.

Aunque las resoluciones del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU son jurídicamente vinculantes, pueden ser --y lo han sido en el pasado-- ignoradas, ya que los mecanismos de aplicación de la ONU son limitados.

El secretario general de la ONU, António Guterres, dijo que no aplicar la resolución sería ""imperdonable"".

""El Consejo de Seguridad acaba de aprobar una resolución largamente esperada sobre Gaza, exigiendo un alto el fuego inmediato y la liberación inmediata e incondicional de todos los rehenes.

Esta resolución debe aplicarse. Un fracaso sería imperdonable"", escribió Guterres en X, antes conocido como Twitter.

La votación de la ONU de este lunes se produjo mientras crecen las tensiones por una inminente operación militar israelí en la ciudad meridional de Rafah, en Gaza. Estados Unidos. ha pedido a Israel que explique cómo protegerá a los 1,4 millones de palestinos que buscan refugio allí antes de la esperada incursión, que según EE.UU. ""sería un error"".

El asesor de seguridad nacional de Israel, Tzachi Hanegbi, y Ron Dermer, miembro del gabinete de guerra y estrecho asesor de Netanyahu, tenían previsto viajar a Washington el lunes por la noche para discutir la ofensiva y las alternativas estadounidenses, pero la visita fue cancelada tras la votación.

El portavoz de Seguridad Nacional, John Kirby, ofreció una respuesta más completa a la decisión de Netanyahu de cancelar la delegación, diciendo que EE.UU. estaba decepcionado por la decisión de cancelar el viaje.

""Estamos muy decepcionados por el hecho de que no vayan a venir a Washington, DC, para permitirnos mantener una conversación exhaustiva con ellos sobre alternativas viables a la intervención sobre el terreno en Rafah"", declaró.

Por otra parte, Israel aceptó la propuesta estadounidense de un acuerdo sobre prisioneros y rehenes, según informó el analista de CNN Barak Ravid en la reciente ronda de conversaciones de Doha. El acuerdo podría suponer la liberación de unos 700 presos palestinos, entre ellos 100 condenados a cadena perpetua por asesinar a ciudadanos israelíes, a cambio de la liberación de 40 rehenes israelíes retenidos por Hamas en Gaza.

Sin embargo, Hamas afirmó que quedan más cuestiones por resolver aparte de la liberación de los presos palestinos de las cárceles israelíes. Basem Naeim, alto cargo de Hamas, declaró a CNN que ""los medios de comunicación israelíes-estadounidenses"" estaban añadiendo presión a las conversaciones.

""Para nosotros, las negociaciones no se centran únicamente en el acuerdo de intercambio de prisioneros"", afirmó.

""Israel no ha accedido a ninguna de las peticiones [de Hamas] relacionadas con un alto el fuego completo, la retirada de todas las fuerzas de Gaza, aunque sea por etapas, y el regreso a sus hogares de todas las personas desplazadas"", afirmó Naeim.

91,"La historia del país que le quitó el ""Santa"" a la Semana Santa","Imagen de archivo. (Crédito: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)

(CNN Español) -- ""¿Qué planes tenés para Semana Santa?"", le pregunté días atrás a una amiga. ""Semana de Turismo, dirás"", me corrigió rápidamente, en tono medio broma, medio serio. Y es que en Uruguay –oficialmente– la semana clave del calendario de los cristianos quedó despojada del adjetivo ""santa"" hace más de 100 años. En las leyes, es la Semana de Turismo. Y también se ha hecho de otros nombres populares, como Semana Criolla y hasta Semana de la Cerveza, dependiendo del lugar en el que te encuentres.

No hay que confundirse: en Uruguay, el cristianismo –la fe mayoritaria– celebra libremente la Semana Santa (aunque, eso sí, con una visibilidad menor a la de países como España). Y los huevos y los conejos de Pascua son ultrapopulares. Sin embargo, desde comienzos del siglo XX, las leyes no la reconocen a esa semana como tal, sino como la Semana de Turismo, que cada año coincide en fechas con la Semana Santa de los cristianos.

El cambio se remonta a 1919, cuando se secularizaron los feriados religiosos: la Semana Santa pasó a ser la Semana de Turismo, la Navidad se convirtió en el Día de la Familia, al Día de Reyes se lo designó como Día de los Niños y al Día de la Virgen como Día de las Playas.

El cambio de los nombres de los feriados es apenas una de las múltiples acciones que llevó adelante el país entre fines del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX, para separar completamente al Estado de la Iglesia católica, algo que ya había quedado garantizado en la Constitución de 1919. Se trata de un proceso tan singular en la región que se ha convertido en caso de estudio para los académicos.

De los cementerios a los feriados: ¿cómo se deshizo Uruguay de los símbolos religiosos?

El primer hito significativo que marcó este proceso de secularización del país sucedió tan pronto como en 1861, apenas unos 30 años después de que el país aprobara su primera Constitución. Ese año, los cementerios, que estaban bajo el control de la Iglesia, pasaron a estar bajo la órbita del Estado. De allí en adelante, hasta que en 1917 se aprobó una constitución que separó formalmente a la Iglesia del Estado y garantizó la libertad de culto, la institución católica fue perdiendo cada vez más poder real y simbólico.

En 1885, por ejemplo, se volvió obligatorio el matrimonio civil antes del religioso. Y pocos años después, en 1907, se aprobó la ley de divorcio y se suprimieron las referencia a Dios y los evangelios en el juramento de los parlamentarios. Un año antes, se había definido remover todos los crucifijos de los hospitales públicos.

Uno de las decisiones más significativas llegó en 1909, cuando se suprimió la enseñanza de la religión en las escuelas públicas. José Pedro Varela, el impulsor de la educación laica, gratuita y obligatoria en el país, resumía años antes en estas palabras el espíritu que guió las decisiones de los políticos de la época: “No profesemos ningún culto, pero tengamos la religión del porvenir, con la mirada fija en la estrella de la justicia, que nos alumbre; marchemos incesantemente preparando el establecimiento de la democracia, en la que el pueblo, convertido en sacerdote y en rey, tendrá por guía y por Dios a la libertad”.

El proceso, no obstante, no fue uniforme. Las primeras decisiones, según académicos como Roger Gaymonat, no necesariamente tenían como intención volver laico al país. Sin embrago, a partir de 1885 sí se desató una “tormenta anticlerical” y desde los primeros años del siglo XX ya hubo una ofensiva de la mano del presidente que moldearía el Uruguay moderno: José Batlle y Ordóñez, quien gobernó entre 1903 y 1907, y 1911 y 1915.

De Turismo, Criolla, de la Cerveza...

Despojada de su santidad, la Semana de Turismo en Uruguay se hizo de múltiples nombres vinculados a las fiestas que se celebran a lo largo y ancho del pequeño país sudamericano. En Montevideo, por ejemplo, destaca la Semana Criolla, un evento organizado por el Gobierno de la ciudad que tiene como espectáculo central las populares y también polémicas jineteadas, en las que los jinetes muestran su habilidad para mantenerse montando caballos salvajes por el mayor tiempo posible en un ruedo (una práctica que ha sido fuertemente cuestionada por organizaciones de activistas por el bienestar animal).

En Paysandú, departamento ubicado en el norte del país, la Semana Santa se ha convertido en Semana de la Cerveza. Hace más de 50 años, un trabajador de una industria cervecera del lugar propuso la organización de un festival que coincidiera con los festivos de Turismo y desde entonces la fiesta ha crecido. Además de cerveza, por supuesto, hay ofertas de espectáculos, gastronomía y artesanías, entre otros.

¿En qué creen los uruguayos?

Una investigación del Pew Research Center de 2014, que se sigue utilizando como referencia en estudios académicos, situaba a Uruguay en la cúspide de países latinoamericanos con más personas sin filiación religiosa: un 37 % en total, dividido entre aquellos que no tienen una religión particular (24 %), los ateos (10 %) y los que se definen como agnósticos (3 %).

El Pew califica a Uruguay como un caso “atípico”. “En ningún otro país de Latinoamérica encuestado las personas sin filiación religiosa llegan incluso al 20 %” de la población”, afirma. Para ponerlo en contexto, en los países vecinos estos porcentajes ascienden a 11 %, en el caso de Argentina, y 8 %, en el caso de Brasil. En el otro extremo de la lista regional está Paraguay, donde apenas un 1 % entra en estas categorías.

En cuanto a la filiación religiosa de quienes sí se declaran como parte de una religión, el estudio del Pew Research Center registra un 42 % de católicos, 15 % de protestantes y 6 % pertenecientes a “otras” religiones.

92,"AMLO: Trump no construirá el muro ""porque nos entendemos muy bien""","AMLO niega la construcción de un muro entre México y EE.UU. 1:55

(CNN Español) -- El presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, dijo que el expresidente de Estados Unidos Donald Trump no construirá el muro en caso de ganar un segundo mandato en las elecciones de noviembre.

En una entrevista con el programa ""60 Minutes"" de CBS, que se emite la noche de este domingo, López Obrador comentó que Trump no construirá el muro ""porque nos entendemos muy bien"".

""No (va a construir el muro) porque nos entendemos muy bien. Firmamos un tratado comercial y económico que ha sido favorable para los dos pueblos, para los dos países. Él lo sabe. Y el presidente Biden también"", dijo López Obrador en un avance de la entrevista.

El tema del muro apareció en la conversación luego de que el presidente mexicano fuera cuestionado sobre la renovada promesa en campaña de Trump de acabar con los vacíos en el muro fronterizo que divide a Estados Unidos y México.

En su campaña a la presidencia de 2016, Trump prometió terminar de construir el muro fronterizo entre ambos países e incluso dijo que México pagaría por ello, pero ninguna de las dos cosas ocurrió, según una verificación de información realizada por CNN.

Trump dijo en varias ocasiones en esa campaña que EE.UU. necesitaba alrededor de 1.600 kilómetros de muro fronterizo con México; sin embargo, en su gobierno se terminaron construyendo solo 737 km, y gran parte de esta cantidad fue para reemplazar estructura existente.

Migrantes en San Diego eluden el muro fronterizo saltando una roca 3:26

Cuando terminó su mandato, el Gobierno de Trump tenía planeados otros 280 kilómetros de muro, pero no fueron ejecutados.

La frontera de Estados Unidos con México tiene más de 3.057 kilómetros de largo. Como señaló Trump durante su campaña de 2016, las barreras naturales dificultan el cruce en algunos tramos incluso sin muro.

93,Así puedes ver el próximo eclipse lunar de luna de gusano,"¿Cómo es el proceso para fotografiar un eclipse? 1:26

(CNN) -- Una brillante luna de gusano iluminará el cielo este lunes con una actuación celestial reservada para quienes se aventuren en las primeras horas de la mañana: un eclipse lunar penumbral.

La luna llena de marzo, conocida como la luna de gusano por el Almanaque de los Agricultores debido a su proximidad al equinoccio de primavera, estará en su punto más alto a las 3 a.m. hora del este.

Unas horas antes, a partir de las 12:53 a.m. hora del este, según EarthSky, la luna estará casi perfectamente alineada con el sol y la Tierra, lo que hará que el borde exterior de la sombra de la Tierra, conocido como penumbra, se proyecte sobre el orbe brillante.

El eclipse máximo será a las 3:12 a.m. hora del este, cuando la luna parecerá estar ligeramente más oscura de lo habitual, dijo la Dra. Shannon Schmoll, directora del Planetario Abrams de la Universidad Estatal de Michigan.

""Será casi un gradiente de oscurecimiento que ocurre de un lado de la luna al otro. No va a ser un cambio súper dramático en lo que vemos en la luna"", dijo Schmoll. ""Pero si estás sentado allí observándolo, podrías notar algunas variaciones leves en el brillo"".

publicidad

La luna de gusano, nombrada así por las tribus nativas americanas en referencia a las larvas de escarabajos y otras criaturas que emergen de la hibernación en la primavera, será visible para todos en el mundo, ya que la luna parecerá estar llena durante un par de días.

Sin embargo, el eclipse penumbral solo será visible para aquellos que estén en el lado nocturno de la Tierra cuando ocurra el evento, incluyendo Europa, Asia del Norte y del Este, Australia, África, América del Norte y del Sur. El eclipse lunar terminará a las 5:33 a.m. hora del este, según EarthSky.

El eclipse penumbral ocurre aproximadamente dos semanas antes de un eclipse solar total que cruzará México, Estados Unidos y Canadá el 8 de abril. Los eclipses lunares y solares siempre vienen en pares debido al período en el que el sol, la Tierra y la luna permanecen alineados, dijo Schmoll. Mientras que la luna llena quedará atrapada en la sombra de la Tierra durante este eclipse penumbral, la próxima fase de luna nueva de la luna permitirá las condiciones necesarias para un eclipse solar, cuando la luna estará entre el sol y la Tierra y, por lo tanto, bloqueará la vista de la cara del sol.

Temporada de eclipses

Una ""temporada de eclipses"" es el período aproximado de 35 días que ocurre cada seis meses, cerca de los equinoccios, cuando ocurre la alineación casi perfecta de los tres cuerpos celestes necesarios para los eclipses, según la NASA.

Un eclipse lunar no ocurre mensualmente durante cada luna llena porque el plano orbital de la luna está inclinado aproximadamente 5 grados, por lo que para la mayoría de las lunas llenas, la sombra de la Tierra estará justo debajo o arriba de la luna, dijo Schmoll.

Mientras que un eclipse penumbral no es tan dramático como un eclipse lunar total con la luna apareciendo de un rojo inquietante, no se requiere equipo especial para ver un eclipse lunar como los anteojos necesarios para un eclipse solar, dijo Schmoll, lo que permite que los eclipses lunares se vean a simple vista.

""Básicamente solo necesitas estar afuera con una vista clara de la luna cuando esté ocurriendo"", agregó Schmoll. ""(Los eclipses son) siempre una buena excusa para salir y tratar de mirar al cielo y apreciar dónde estamos en el universo y lo que podemos observar desde nuestro planeta"".

Eclipses solares y lunares

Si bien el evento más esperado de los cuatro eclipses que ocurrirán en 2024 es el eclipse solar total del 8 de abril, un eclipse solar anular ocurrirá el 2 de octubre sobre partes de América del Sur. Este tipo de eclipse es similar a un eclipse solar total, excepto que la luna está en el punto más lejano de su órbita desde la Tierra, por lo que no puede bloquear completamente el sol. En cambio, los eclipses solares anulares crean un ""anillo de fuego"" en el cielo mientras la luz ardiente del sol rodea la sombra de la luna.

Mientras tanto, un eclipse lunar parcial, en el que la Tierra se mueve entre el sol y la luna llena sin estar perfectamente alineada, aparecerá sobre Europa y gran parte de Asia, África, América del Norte y del Sur entre el 17 y el 18 de septiembre.

Más lunas llenas este año

De las 12 lunas llenas en 2024, los eventos lunares de septiembre y octubre se considerarán superlunas, según EarthSky.

Las definiciones de una superluna pueden variar, pero el término generalmente denota una luna llena que está más cerca de la Tierra de lo normal y, por lo tanto, parece más grande y brillante en el cielo nocturno. Algunos astrónomos dicen que el fenómeno ocurre cuando la luna está dentro del 90% del perigeo, su aproximación más cercana a la Tierra en la órbita.

Aquí están las lunas llenas restantes de 2024:

• 23 de abril: Luna rosa

• 23 de mayo: Luna de flores

• 21 de junio: Luna de fresa

• 21 de julio: Luna del ciervo

• 19 de agosto: Luna del esturión

• 17 de septiembre: Luna de la cosecha

• 17 de octubre: Luna del cazador

• 15 de noviembre: Luna del castor

• 15 de diciembre: Luna fría

Lluvias de meteoros de 2024

Los observadores del cielo pueden esperar una multitud de lluvias de meteoros este año, según la Sociedad Americana de Meteoros. Aquí están las fechas en las que se espera que los eventos de meteoros alcancen su punto máximo este año.

• Líridas: 21-22 de abril.

• Eta Acuáridas: 4-5 de mayo.

• Acuáridas del sur delta: 29-30 de julio.

Poco más de un año y medio después, en septiembre de 2023, López Obrador anunció en su conferencia matutina que May dejaría Fonatur para buscar la candidatura al Gobierno de Tabasco.

97,Netanyahu cancela viaje de delegación israelí a Washington tras abstención de EE.UU. en la ONU,"Palestinos intentan salir del hospital Al-Shifa en Gaza 4:48

(CNN) -- El primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, canceló un viaje previsto a Washington de dos de sus principales asesores después de que Estados Unidos no vetara una resolución del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU en la que se pedía un alto el fuego inmediato y la liberación incondicional de todos los rehenes de Gaza, según informaron dos funcionarios israelíes.

Estados Unidos se abstuvo en la votación de la resolución, lo que permitió su aprobación.

El asesor de seguridad nacional de Israel, Tzachi Hanegbi, y Ron Dermer, miembro del gabinete de guerra y estrecho asesor de Netanyahu, tenían previsto viajar a Washington este lunes por la noche para debatir la prevista ofensiva terrestre israelí en Rafah y las alternativas estadounidenses.

La oficina de Netanyahu dijo anteriormente este lunes que Netanyahu había amenazado con cancelar su viaje si EE.UU. no vetaba una resolución que no condicionara el alto el fuego a la liberación de los rehenes. La Oficina del primer ministro había indicado anteriormente que se trataba de dos resoluciones distintas, lo que no era cierto.

La resolución del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que se aprobó ""exige un alto el fuego inmediato para el mes de Ramadán respetado por todas las partes que conduzca a un alto el fuego duradero y sostenible, y exige también la liberación inmediata e incondicional de todos los rehenes"".

Secretario general de la ONU pide alto el fuego en Gaza 3:12

EE.UU. ha pedido a Israel que explique cómo piensa mantener a salvo a los 1,4 millones de palestinos que se calcula que buscan refugio en el sur de Gaza, mientras Israel advierte que pronto lanzará una ofensiva militar contra Rafah. Hasta ahora, dice el gobierno de Biden, no se ha presentado ese plan.

Este lunes, el consejero de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU., Jake Sullivan, dijo a periodistas que el presidente Joe Biden había pedido a Netanyahu que enviara un equipo a Washington ""para escuchar las preocupaciones de EE.UU. sobre la planificación actual de Israel en Rafah y para presentar un enfoque alternativo que apuntaría a elementos clave de Hamas en Rafah y aseguraría la frontera entre Egipto y Gaza sin una gran invasión terrestre"".

Operaciones en dos hospitales de Gaza

Por otro lado, las tropas israelíes continuaban este lunes con ""actividades operativas precisas"" tanto en el hospital de Al-Shifa, en el norte de Gaza, como en el de Al Amal, en Khan Younis.

La operación en Al-Shifa comenzó el lunes pasado, y el hospital ha estado sitiado desde entonces. Las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) detuvieron a 500 personas que dicen que son ""terroristas"", aunque no facilitan detalles ni pruebas sobre los individuos que dan cuenta de las detenciones.

CNN no puede verificar de forma independiente las cifras debido a las restricciones de información en Gaza.

En el hospital Al Amal, 20 personas, calificadas como terroristas por las FDI, murieron en combates cuerpo a cuerpo con las tropas israelíes que cercaron la zona, según un comunicado conjunto emitido este lunes por las FDI y la Agencia de Seguridad de Israel (ASI).

""Durante el último día, las FDI y la ASI facilitaron la salida de cientos de gazatíes de la zona"", dice el comunicado.

La Media Luna Roja Palestina (MLRP) afirma que dos miembros de su equipo resultaron heridos por disparos de las tropas israelíes cuando abandonaban la zona del hospital tras recibir la orden de hacerlo. El equipo de la MLRP se había detenido para retirar los escombros de la carretera que ralentizaban su salida, cuando al parecer las tropas israelíes abrieron fuego, añade un comunicado de la MLRP.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com
98,"Dave Calhoun, CEO de Boeing, dejará su cargo","Boeing suma otro problema con sus aviones 2:30

(CNN) -- En una importante reorganización de la dirección de Boeing, el CEO de la empresa, Dave Calhoun, dijo este lunes que tiene la intención de abandonar la compañía a finales de año. El presidente de la compañía y el jefe de la unidad de aviones comerciales también se van.

El presidente de Boeing, Larry Kellner, no se presentará a la reelección como director del consejo. El consejo eligió al ex-CEO de Qualcomm Steve Mollenkopf para sucederle.

La empresa también anunció que Stan Deal, CEO de Boeing Commercial Airplanes, se jubila. Stephanie Pope, directora de Operaciones de Boeing desde enero, ocupará su lugar con efecto inmediato.

Boeing se ha visto sacudida por más de cinco años de problemas con sus aviones, incluidos dos accidentes fatales del 737 Max en 2018 y 2019 que mataron a 346 personas, y más recientemente un tapón de puerta que estalló en el costado de un 737 Max de Alaska Airlines en enero, dejando un enorme agujero en el costado del avión. Los problemas han provocado múltiples inmovilizaciones en tierra por problemas de seguridad y más de US$ 31.000 millones en pérdidas acumuladas.

En una carta de este lunes dirigida a los empleados de Boeing, Calhoun calificó el incidente de Alaska Airlines de ""momento decisivo para Boeing"".

publicidad

""Los ojos del mundo están puestos en nosotros"", dijo al anunciar sus planes de salida. ""Vamos a arreglar lo que no funciona y vamos a volver a encarrilar nuestra empresa hacia la recuperación y la estabilidad"".

Calhoun, de 66 años, miembro del consejo de Boeing desde hace mucho tiempo, se convirtió en presidente de la compañía a finales de 2019, cuando el consejo despojó a su predecesor Dennis Muilenburg de ese título. Fue nombrado CEO después de que Muilenburg fuera destituido en diciembre de ese año, y comenzó en el cargo en enero de 2020.

El mandato de Calhoun comenzó aproximadamente a la mitad de un periodo de 20 meses de inmovilización de los 737 Max debido a un defecto de diseño que se determinó que había causado los dos accidentes fatales; y justo antes de que estallara la pandemia de covid-19 en todo el mundo, causando una paralización casi total de los viajes aéreos y pérdidas masivas para las aerolíneas de las que Boeing depende para comprar sus aviones.

99,"Dani Alves sale en libertad provisional tras pagar fianza de US$1,1 millones","El presidente de Brasil habla sobre el caso Dani Alves 0:54

(CNN Español) -- El jugador de fútbol brasileño, Dani Alves, salió este lunes por la tarde en libertad provisional tras pagar una fianza de US$1,1 millones que solicitó el tribunal que lo condenó en febrero a cuatro años y seis meses de prisión por agredir sexualmente a una mujer a finales de 2022.

Su salida del centro penitenciario Brians 2, donde se encontraba recluido desde enero de 2023, se produjo cerca de las 4:25 p.m., hora local, en medio de una gran expectativa de medios de comunicación.

Escoltado por varios agentes de los Mossos d’Esquadra -la policía autonómica de Cataluña- y acompañado de su abogada, Inés Guardiola, el jugador abandonó la prisión sin hacer declaraciones ante los periodistas que se agolpaban en el lugar.

Una vez en libertad provisional, la sección 21 de la Audiencia Provincial de Barcelona impone como medidas cautelares que el jugador no abandone el país, de hecho, su abogada entregó el pasado jueves a la justicia sus dos pasaportes: el español y el brasileño. Deberá presentarse semanalmente ante este órgano judicial y tantas veces se lo requiera la autoridad judicial, la prohibición de comunicarse con la víctima o acercarse a ella a menos de un kilómetro de distancia. De no observar estas medidas, los magistrados advierten de que podrían revertir su decisión.

La decisión de dejar a Alves en libertad provisional mientras se estudian los recursos presentados por cada parte a la sentencia dictada en primera instancia fue tomada por mayoría, que no unanimidad, de los magistrados que lo juzgaron entre el pasado 5 y 7 de febrero. Uno de los magistrados votó en contra de esta decisión dado que aprecia un incremento del riesgo de fuga ante “la posibilidad de que dicha condena pueda verse aumentada en sede de apelación “y que la imposición de una fianza, a pesar de ser elevada, “no es obstáculo para que el acusado pueda tener interés en abandonar España y dirigirse a Brasil, país que no extradita a sus nacionales salvo los naturalizados”.

""The Palestinians in Gaza pleaded and appealed, shouted, cried, cursed, prayed, defied the odds to survive time and time again. And yet continued to face death, destruction and displacement, depravation and disease. And an occupation-made famine.

Donald Trump had been facing the prospect of forking over nearly half a billion dollars today.

But now he has been given 10 more days, and that sum has been reduced down to $175m.

Trump had struggled to come up with $464m in cash, and last week said no private companies had been willing to put up a bond of that size.

With the 10 day extension and a lower amount, his assets are safe from being seized by the state of New York - for now.

This lifeline means Attorney General Letitia James will not be trying to freeze Trump's bank accounts today, and will not be making moves to seize any of his property just yet.

Both of those outcomes were possible before this new decision from an appeals court judge.

The $464m penalty was issued by a judge earlier this year in a civil trial, which found Trump inflated his net worth to secure better deals on loans.",https://www.bbc.com/live
