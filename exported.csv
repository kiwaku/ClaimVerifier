Natural variation vs. inbreeding

It’s not clear what caused the genetic mutation.","Pandas come in different shades, and scientists now understand why",,

2892,"Now, with this new approach, we will be able to start doing so.”","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2893,"CNN reached out to the International Bottled Water Association, which represents the industry, for a response to the study’s findings.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2894,"“This new method needs to be fully reviewed by the scientific community and more research needs to be done to develop standardized methods for measuring and quantifying nanoplastics in our environment,” a spokesperson for the association told CNN via email.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2895,“There currently is both a lack of standardized methods and no scientific consensus on the potential health impacts of nano- and microplastic particles.,"Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2896,"Therefore, media reports about these particles in drinking water do nothing more than unnecessarily scare consumers.”","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2897,Which plastics are you swallowing?,"Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2898,"The study’s new method of identifying nanoparticles in bottled water relies on a modified version of Raman spectroscopy, a laser-based technique that can analyze the chemical composition of cells by measuring how molecules vibrate in response to light.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2899,"The altered version, called stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, or SRS, adds a second laser to “amplify the previous signal by several orders of magnitude, allowing the previously unseen nanoparticle to be detected,” said senior author Wei Min, a professor of chemistry at Columbia University in New York City, who coinvented SRS in 2008.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2900,"“This study is the first one to apply this microscopy to the nanoplastic world,” Min said.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2901,"By dramatically boosting the image, SRS can clearly identify and capture images of nanoparticles in microseconds rather than the hours needed by the older technique — and do so without harming the tissues being imaged.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2902,“But seeing the particles is not good enough because how do you know this is plastic or not?,"Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2903,"To do that we developed a new machine-based learning technology that allows us to identify and classify which plastic it is,” Yan said.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2904,"At the time of publication, the study’s algorithm was able to identify seven types of plastics: polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2905,"“Based on other studies we expected most of the microplastics in bottled water would come from leakage of the plastic bottle itself, which is typically made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic,” said lead author Naixin Qian, a doctoral student in chemistry at Columbia University.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2906,"“However, we found there’s actually many diverse types of plastics in a bottle of water, and that different plastic types have different size distributions,” she said.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2907,"“The PET particles were larger, while others were down to 200 nanometers, which is much, much smaller.”

Studies have found that particles of PET plastics can be broken off by repeatedly opening and closing the cap of the bottle, crushing the bottle or subjecting it to heat, such as in a car.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2908,"Much more research to be done

Now that nanoplastics can be identified and classified","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2909,", it’s possible to research the answer to all sorts of questions.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2910,"For example, if the nanoplastics floating in the bottled water weren’t from the bottle itself, where did they come from?","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2911,"The Columbia team is investigating a hypothesis that the other nanoplastics may come from source water, perhaps tainted by some part of the manufacturing process.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2912,"Another important question: Which has fewer nanoplastics and chemical residues, bottled or tap water?

“Several studies have reported lower microplastic levels in tap water.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2913,"Hence, it’s plausible to expect lower nanoplastic levels in tap water as well, considering their common sources,” Yan said.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2914,“We’re conducting research on that right now.”,"Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2915,What happens once the plastic polymer and the endocrine-disrupting chemicals enter the body’s cells?,"Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2916,"Do the invaders remain, wreaking havoc by disrupting or damaging cellular processes, or does the body succeed in kicking them out?","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2917,"“We know these microparticles are getting into the body, and we know even greater percentages of the smaller nanoparticles are getting into cells, but we don’t know exactly where they’re going in the cell or what they are doing,” Stapleton said.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2918,“And we don’t know if or how they’re getting back out again.”,"Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2919,"However, the new technology is well-suited to analyzing human tissue samples and should soon provide some answers, Min said.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2920,"“If you look at our raw data, it’s actually a series of images,” Min said.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2921,"“In fact, we have plenty of data to show if a particle has entered a particular location in a certain type of cell, then we will be able to locate it precisely in space.”","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
2922,"While science explores these and other questions, there are things people can do to reduce their exposure to plastics, said Healthy Babies, Bright Futures’ Houlihan.","Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",,
